Jaipur Living, too faced similar issues while managing their B2B and B2C customers, which hampered their customer experience and overall growth. Collaborating with i95Dev i95Dev experts conducted a thorough discovery session with their team to understand the platforms, business processes, customers, etc. An ERP integration was suggested where i95Dev implemented its Microsoft Dynamics NAV Connector to overcome the challenges. Magento Capability Firstly i95Dev’s team made them aware that Magento has 100% capacity to handle both B2B and B2C customers effectively. Customer Enablement Though the two types of customers required a different set of features, the need was to understand the ability of Magento to cater to these customers uniquely. i95Dev provided the necessary training to make the utmost use of the platforms involved. Integration Gap i95Dev experts suggested the challenges faced in pricing, order, and inventory management, were because of the lack of integration between Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Magento. Seamless Integration ERP integration with Magento with i95Dev’s Connector eliminated duplicate customer entries thereby reducing hours of manual work and eliminating human errors. Custom Pricing i95Dev Connector’s Customer Specific Pricing feature offered pricing by customers and item discount pricing. This feature solved the problem of assigning prices and discounts basis different customers, items, customers groups, and item groups. In addition to this, i95Dev also customized a pricing feature where discounts can be applied as salesperson Discount % or CSR Discount. Order Sync For order management, i95Dev provided a solution that allowed bi-directional sync of orders from Magento e-store to NAV and vice-versa. This resulted in keeping both the systems updated at one go therefore eliminating manual work, wrong, duplicate orders, and saving transport costs.

Evaluate Expertise and Experience: Scrutinize portfolios, case studies, and testimonials for a partner’s proficiency in developing and managing Magento-powered websites. The proof of proficiency lies in the portfolio and case studies .

An inexperienced partner might struggle to maintain the website effectively, impacting its stability and performance. Limited Scalability: Inadequate expertise can result in websites that aren’t built for scalability. As your business grows, the website might struggle to handle increased traffic and transactions, hampering your expansion plans 3. Certification and Partnership Status: Verify the partner’s certification and partnership level with Magento to ensure their dedication and competence. The journey of a Magento Partner is marked by certifications and partnership tiers. These accolades signify not only expertise but also the commitment of the partner to the Magento platform. Scrutinize the partner’s certification portfolio to ascertain that they possess the necessary skills to navigate Magento’s intricacies. Moreover, delve into their partnership level, as it reflects the depth of their engagement with Magento. Partnerships are segmented into levels such as Solution Partner, Select Partner, and Business Partner, each signifying a varying degree of expertise. A higher partnership status underscores their dedication, proficiency, and alignment with Magento’s standards. Impact: Risk of Errors: Inexperienced or uncertified partners are more likely to make errors in development, customization, and maintenance. These mistakes can lead to functionality issues, security vulnerabilities, and potential data breaches. Inadequate Expertise: Partnering with an uncertified or lower-tier partner might mean working with professionals lacking the necessary skills. This can result in suboptimal solutions, poor website performance, and limitations in leveraging Magento’s full potential. Limited Support: Lower-tier partners might lack access to essential resources and support from Magento. This could lead to longer response times for addressing issues, hindering your ability to maintain a seamless online presence. 4. Range of Services: Confirm if the partner offers end-to-end services, including design, development, integration, customization, and ongoing support, diverse skill sets Your Adobe Commerce Partner should be your comprehensive ally. Confirm that their services span the entire spectrum of your project’s lifecycle. Starting from the initial design phase, they should offer insights and solutions that harmonize with your brand identity and customer expectations. Development capabilities should encompass intricate coding and feature implementation, ensuring your online store is functional and user-friendly. Integration expertise becomes paramount for seamless interactions between various systems and tools. The capacity for customization is vital for tailoring your store to your unique business model. Ongoing support and maintenance should be part of their commitment, guaranteeing that your store remains optimized and glitch-free even after the initial launch. Diverse Skillsets and Expertise: A capable partner brings together diverse skillsets to create a well-rounded team. Their solution architects craft a strategic roadmap that aligns with your brand identity and customer expectations.

Development Proficiency: Development capabilities are pivotal for turning design concepts into functional reality. The partner’s development team, armed with intricate coding skills, ensures seamless feature implementation that makes your online store not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly. Journey with i95Dev Impact: Fragmented Solutions: Choosing a partner with limited services may result in fragmented solutions. This can lead to compatibility issues, disjointed user experiences, and a lack of cohesive branding across your eCommerce platform. Integration Challenges: If a partner lacks integration services, you might struggle to connect your eCommerce platform with essential business tools such as CRMs, ERPs, and payment gateways. This can hinder efficient operations and customer interactions. Limited Adaptability: Without a partner offering comprehensive services, your website might lack the adaptability required for changing business needs. This can hinder your ability to quickly implement new features or respond to market shifts. Functionality Gaps: Inadequate development capabilities may lead to functionality gaps and technical issues within your Adobe Commerce platform. This can result in a website that doesn’t function properly, leading to frustrated users and lost sales. 5. Client Support and Communication: Gauge communication channels, responsiveness, and post-project support. Effective communication forms the backbone of any successful partnership. Evaluate how the partner facilitates communication—do they provide multiple channels for easy interaction and updates? Responsiveness is a key indicator of their commitment to your project’s success. A partner who promptly addresses your queries and concerns is more likely to deliver a smooth and efficient collaboration. Equally crucial is post-project support. After your online store is launched, you might encounter minor hiccups or require adjustments. Confirm that the partner offers reliable post-launch support to ensure your store’s continuous optimal performance. Incorporating these detailed assessments into your search for the right Adobe Commerce Partner empowers you to make an informed and strategic decision. Remember, the partner you choose becomes an integral extension of your business, influencing the trajectory of your eCommerce venture’s success. Impact: Lack of Post-Project Support: Partnering with a provider that doesn’t offer robust post-project support can leave you stranded when issues arise after launch. This can lead to prolonged disruptions and lost revenue if problems aren’t resolved promptly. Missed Growth Opportunities: A partner that doesn’t stay in touch and provide ongoing support might miss opportunities to enhance your eCommerce platform as your business evolves. This can hinder your ability to adapt to market changes and customer preferences Delayed Issue Resolution: Without a partner committed to responsiveness, you might encounter delays in addressing technical issues and resolving critical problems. This can result in extended periods of downtime, affecting your sales and customer trust. 6. Local presence: Understand local market, cultural alignment, time-zone advantage, site performance. A partner with local presence is more likely to have a deep understanding of the local market dynamics, trends, and consumer behaviors. This insight is invaluable when tailoring your eCommerce platform to match regional preferences and needs. Being in the same time zone reduces communication delays and ensures prompt responses. This is particularly important for resolving urgent issues, especially during critical phases of your eCommerce project. Geographic proximity can positively impact website performance, especially when it comes to server response times and loading speeds. A local partner can optimize your site’s performance for the local audience. In summary, a local presence can provide unique insights, cultural alignment, and efficient collaboration that contribute to the success of your Adobe Commerce project. It ensures that your partner understands the local landscape and can tailor solutions that resonate with your target audience. Impact: Suboptimal Performance: Geographic distance might impact website performance, resulting in slower loading times for users in the region. This can lead to higher bounce rates and decreased user satisfaction. Limited Local Insights: Without a local partner’s insights, your eCommerce platform might lack the fine-tuned strategies necessary to capture the local market’s attention and drive conversions. Missed Cultural Relevance: A partner without local presence might overlook cultural nuances and preferences, leading to a disconnected user experience that fails to resonate with the local audience. 7. Strategic Considerations: Project Timeline and Costing – Budget alignment and feasebility, the value of the investment, ability and future cost When selecting the ideal Adobe Commerce partner, an integrated assessment of project timeline and costing is paramount. These two facets are intertwined, influencing the trajectory of your eCommerce venture. An optimal project timeline ensures that your business objectives are met within the desired timeframe, while prudent costing safeguards financial health. Balancing these factors fosters resource allocation for quality output, and transparency in costing practices builds trust. As you evaluate potential partners, their proposed timeline and costing should be aligned with your vision and budget, forging a partnership poised for both efficient delivery and financial viability. Impact Project Delays: Without a well-defined project timeline, there’s a higher risk of project delays. This can lead to missed opportunities, postponed revenue generation, and increased frustration among stakeholders. Budget Overruns: Ignoring cost considerations may result in unexpected budget overruns, causing financial strain and potentially limiting the scope of your project.

      "content": "URGENT Security Advisory: SessionReaper (CVE-2025-54236) – Adobe Commerce & Magento Open-Source A newly discovered critical vulnerability, SessionReaper (CVE-2025-54236), impacts Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source. This flaw allows account takeover without user interaction through the Commerce REST API and has been rated 9.1/10 Critical on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Adobe has released a hotfix (VULN-32437-2-4-X-patch). Merchants must apply it immediately and verify patch status to avoid exposure. What happened Security researchers discovered an input-validation flaw in the Commerce REST API that lets an attacker forge or manipulate session-related input and gain access to customer accounts. Because the exploit requires no customer action, its impact is especially severe for merchants handling sensitive customer and payment data. Identifiers & references CVE: CVE-2025-54236 Nickname: SessionReaper NVD severity: 9.1 / 10 Adobe Security Bulletin: APSB25-88 Hotfix: VULN-32437-2-4-X-patch Who is affected Adobe Commerce – 2.4.9-alpha2 and earlier (includes 2.4.8-p2, 2.4.7-p7, 2.4.6-p12, 2.4.5-p14, 2.4.4-p15, and other patch versions). Adobe Commerce B2B — 1.5.3-alpha2 and earlier (and listed patch families). Magento Open Source — 2.4.9-alpha2 and earlier (and listed patch families). Custom Attributes Serializable module — versions 0.1.0 → 0.4.0. If your platform version or any of the listed modules match the ranges above, you are at risk. Immediate actions (one-page checklist) Apply Adobe’s hotfix: VULN-32437-2-4-X-patch — apply immediately to affected instances. Update module (if applicable) composers require Magento/out-of-process-custom-attributes=0.4.0 –with-dependencies Verify patch application using the Quality Patches Tool or your normal patch verification workflow. Check logs & user accounts: review authentication logs and unusual session activity (failed/successful logins, new admin/customer account creations, session anomalies). If on Adobe Commerce Cloud: confirm WAF rules are active (Adobe deployed WAF protections), but do not rely solely on the WAF, apply the hotfix anyway. If you’re on Managed Services: contact your Customer Success Engineer for guided remediation and validation. Rotate keys & credentials used by integrations that depend on user sessions or API authentication if you suspect compromise. Monitor for indicators of compromise and enable additional logging and alerting until the environment is confirmed clean. Need help applying the patch? Contact i95Dev’s Adobe Commerce security team for immediate support. Why Is This Urgent? The vulnerability enables account takeover without user interaction, meaning attackers don’t need a phishing click or social engineering to exploit it. A leaked hotfix (reported by researchers) increases the risk: attackers may reverse-engineer the patch to create exploits. Customer data, stored payment instruments, order history and account trust are at stake — any compromise has immediate reputational and regulatory risk. Verification & testing Run integration + smoke tests that exercise login, session creation, and API endpoints. Validate WAF rules (if present) and test that expected traffic patterns are still allowed, and malicious vectors are blocked. Reproduce known attack patterns in a safe staging environment only, do not test exploit techniques on production. Post-patch hardening recommendations Enforce stronger session management and shorter session lifetimes where possible. Add multi-factor authentication for admin and support access. Review third-party extensions for similar input-validation weaknesses. Schedule a follow-up security review and pen test after patching to ensure no lateral issues remain. Action plan template you can use immediately Run an inventory of Magento/Commerce versions & installed modules. Schedule hotfix deployment to staging → test → production (apply hotfix ASAP). Verify with Quality Patches Tool and run session/authentication test cases. Monitor logs for anomalies 24–72 hours after deployment. Communicate to customers if you detect any suspicious account activity (follow regulatory/incident response protocol if needed). Conclusion: If you want to secure your account, i95Dev is here to help. Our Adobe Commerce/ Magento and security specialists will: Assess your site’s exposure Apply and validate the hotfix Audit logs for suspicious activity Implement hardening and continuous monitoring Contact us today to get immediate assistance and protect your customers and your business.",

      "content": "OpenAI Launches ChatGPT App Store: What It Means for Developers & Users | i95dev OpenAI Launches ChatGPT App Store: Ushering in a New Era of Conversational Commerce for eCommerce Leaders In a move poised to reshape digital interactions, OpenAI has officially launched the ChatGPT App Store, opening submissions for third-party developers and transforming the AI chatbot into a bustling hub for embedded applications. Announced just days ago on December 18, this platform—building on the October 2025 release of the Apps SDK—allows seamless integration of services like DoorDash, Apple Music, and Slack directly into ChatGPT conversations, eliminating the need for app downloads or website switches. For e-commerce businesses, this signals an urgent pivot to conversational commerce, where AI-driven dialogues could unlock frictionless chat-to-checkout experiences and tap into a weekly audience of over 800 million users. The launch comes at a pivotal moment for the $6.5 trillion global e-commerce market, already grappling with stagnant conversion rates and rising customer acquisition costs (CAC). As traditional funnels give way to intent-based interactions, e-commerce leaders are racing to embed their brands in this AI-native distribution ecosystem. What is the ChatGPT App Store? At its core, the ChatGPT App Store functions as an in-product directory accessible via web, iOS, and Android interfaces. Users discover and engage with apps, from productivity tools like Photoshop to delivery services, without leaving their chat thread. Powered by the new Apps SDK, which includes pre-built templates and UI libraries, developers can now launch conversational experiences in days, not months. This builds on OpenAI’s earlier GPT Store but expands to full-fledged “apps” that handle transactions, data syncing, and multi-turn dialogues. Early integrations highlight e-commerce potential: Imagine querying “best sustainable sneakers under $100” and instantly browsing options from Nike or Adidas, complete with size recommendations and one-click purchase, all within ChatGPT. Why eCommerce Must Embrace Conversational Commerce Now The implications for e-commerce are profound, particularly in B2B and DTC segments where purchase cycles often span multiple touchpoints. Here’s how the ChatGPT App Store disrupts the status quo: Instant Scale and Visibility : With 800 million weekly active users, the platform offers organic reach far surpassing social media ad auctions. E-commerce brands can surface products during high-intent moments, slashing CAC by up to 50% through zero-ad discovery. Streamlined Chat-to-Checkout Flows : Traditional e-commerce funnels—plagued by 70% cart abandonment—fade in favor of AI-orchestrated transactions. Users express needs (“bulk office supplies for 50 employees”), and apps deliver curated catalogs, pricing, and secure payments in real-time. From SEO to Intent-Driven Discovery : Search engine optimization (SEO) yields to conversational triggers. As McKinsey notes in its 2025 AI survey, agentic interfaces like these could add $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in economic value by enhancing personalization and reducing friction in B2B procurement. Strategies for eCommerce Brands to Capitalize on the Launch Forward-thinking e-commerce leaders are already submitting apps to secure prime “shelf space” in the nascent directory, where competition remains low. Key tactics include: Leverage the Apps SDK for Quick Wins : Use OpenAI’s developer tools to prototype e-commerce bots—think personalized recommendation engines or inventory checkers—that integrate with existing platforms like WooCommerce or BigCommerce. Prioritize High-Intent Triggers : Design apps to activate on specific user prompts, such as “eco-friendly packaging suppliers” for B2B queries, embedding your catalog as the default response. Pilot Transactional Integrations : Test chat-to-checkout with partners like Stripe, focusing on mobile-first experiences to boost mobile commerce conversions, which now account for 60% of e-commerce traffic. Early adopters, including DoorDash and Booking.com, report 30% lifts in user engagement, underscoring the platform’s potential for conversational commerce ROI. Opportunities and Hurdles in the AI eCommerce Shift While the ChatGPT App Store promises a trillion-dollar AI ecosystem by 2030, it’s not without challenges. The directory’s rapid evolution means e-commerce teams must upskill in prompt engineering and AI ethics, while navigating OpenAI’s review process for submissions. Opportunities Challenges Organic discovery to 800M+ users, bypassing paid ads. Short window for early positioning—months, not years—before algorithmic rankings solidify. 15-20% revenue uplift from AI personalization in e-commerce. Infrastructure gaps, like maturing in-chat monetization for digital goods. Natural, context-aware interactions fostering loyalty in B2B e-commerce. Shift from click-based to conversational UIs demands team retraining. The Road Ahead for Conversational Commerce As 2025 draws to a close, the ChatGPT App Store stands as OpenAI’s boldest step toward an “everything app,” blending AI with everyday utilities to redefine e-commerce. For industry leaders, the launch is a clarion call: Integrate now to embed your brand in millions of daily dialogues, or cede ground to agile competitors. With projections signaling a $1 trillion AI market by 2031, the fusion of conversational commerce and e-commerce innovation isn’t optional—it’s the key to thriving in tomorrow’s digital marketplace.",

Founded in 1912 in Chicago, Siegers Seed Company has over a century of experience in delivering unique and quality seeds to farmers across the USA. Recently taken over by Stokes, the company serves commercial growers in the Midwest, Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeastern United States, as well as in Canada. With over 100 years of experience, a wide range of fresh vegetable seeds, and proven traditional trial programs, the leading brand guarantees to serve customers with dependable service and fulfill any vegetable seed need! Industry Agriculture (Vegetable Seeds) Headquarters Holland, Michigan, USA Products used i95Dev’s eCommerce Growth Engine (EGE), Microsoft Dynamics GP I am amazed by the power of the EGE solution – we are only few weeks into the solution but I am already confident that we have chosen the best possible platform to help us grow our business. – Joseph Soriano , IT Manager, Siegers Seed Company How We Made It Happen About the Company Founded in 1912 in Chicago, Siegers Seed Company has over 100 years of expertise in delivering high-quality vegetable seeds to commercial growers across the United States and Canada. Now a part of Stokes, the company continues its legacy of trust and excellence, serving diverse agricultural needs through robust trial programs and an extensive product portfolio. Goals & Challenges The goal was to have an end-to-end integrated eCommerce system. A system that is capable of handling the large portfolio of products Siegers Seed holds. Therefore, reducing the effort and cost associated with managing customers and operations manually (telephone and online ordering system). The second most important goal was to achieve effective warehouse management across all the four warehouses across the USA. Dynamics GP ERP system integrated with the e-store to manage all the back-office operations associated with inventory management and streamlined business processes. i95Dev conducted a thorough analysis of Siegers Seed’s day-to-day operations and associated challenges through a detailed discovery process and recommended its integrated eCommerce solution, EGE. An i95Dev solution that is capable of handling both B2C and B2B businesses. i95Dev implemented EGE that was capable of handling their customers across devices, provided layered navigation, excellent search capabilities, and powerful promotional tools. After the successful implementation, i95Dev conducted EGE’s integration with Dynamics GP seamlessly. This enabled them to better manage inventory by eliminating overselling of products through real-time inventory checks during order placement. The integration also automated the payment, shipping, and taxation method by integration. i95Dev continues to work with Siegers Seed Company to get their B2B customers on to the same platform, including the ability to create separate B2B-specific accounts to place orders directly on the site. 1200+ Projects Completed 450+ Customers across 15+ Countries 25+ Industries Served 150+ eCommerce Enthusiasts Let’s Connect Real Impact.

Now a part of Stokes, the company continues its legacy of trust and excellence, serving diverse agricultural needs through robust trial programs and an extensive product portfolio. Goals & Challenges The goal was to have an end-to-end integrated eCommerce system. A system that is capable of handling the large portfolio of products Siegers Seed holds. Therefore, reducing the effort and cost associated with managing customers and operations manually (telephone and online ordering system). The second most important goal was to achieve effective warehouse management across all the four warehouses across the USA. Dynamics GP ERP system integrated with the e-store to manage all the back-office operations associated with inventory management and streamlined business processes. i95Dev conducted a thorough analysis of Siegers Seed’s day-to-day operations and associated challenges through a detailed discovery process and recommended its integrated eCommerce solution, EGE. An i95Dev solution that is capable of handling both B2C and B2B businesses. i95Dev implemented EGE that was capable of handling their customers across devices, provided layered navigation, excellent search capabilities, and powerful promotional tools. After the successful implementation, i95Dev conducted EGE’s integration with Dynamics GP seamlessly. This enabled them to better manage inventory by eliminating overselling of products through real-time inventory checks during order placement. The integration also automated the payment, shipping, and taxation method by integration. i95Dev continues to work with Siegers Seed Company to get their B2B customers on to the same platform, including the ability to create separate B2B-specific accounts to place orders directly on the site. 1200+ Projects Completed 450+ Customers across 15+ Countries 25+ Industries Served 150+ eCommerce Enthusiasts Let’s Connect",

Drive Shopping Experience Effortless shopping drives sales and customer experience Effortless shopping delivers a smooth, intuitive experience, helping customers find and buy products with ease. By reducing friction and simplifying the journey, businesses boost satisfaction, loyalty, and sales. Experience Drives Value 67% of consumers and 74% of business buyers say they’ll pay more for a great experience. Power of Experience In a recent PwC study, about two-thirds (65%) of respondents in the US feel that a positive experience with a brand is more influential than great advertising. Effortless Wins: Transforming the B2B Buying Journey The number one factor in delivering a great customer experience is not delighting customers but reducing their efforts. However, the product discovery and buying process in the B2B world is usually very complex. This often leads to: Improve Product Discovery The improved product catalog enabled customers to discover new products easily and quickly, reducing the on-field sales effort. Drive Sales The product relationship information helped in identifying cross-selling opportunities and thereby driving sales. Build Efficient Operations The eCommerce ERP integration enabled the merchant to manage all product information from one system. How i95Dev Leveraged Product Relationships To Help a Leading Auto Manufacturer? Overcoming B2B Commerce Challenges in the Auto Aftermarket Industry Operating in a fragmented and mostly offline automobile aftermarket industry, this leading auto parts manufacturer struggled to drive B2B commerce adoption because of the nature of the products and the complex relationship between them. Unstructured product catalogs, complex navigation, and poor search was slowing them down, affecting sales, customer adoption, and customer experience. Unlocking ERP Insights to Power an Advanced Product E-Catalog i95Dev experts conducted an in-depth discovery and worked with the manufacturer to understand the business challenges, data in existing systems, and current business processes. We discovered the goldmine of information that the manufacturer had as product relationships in the ERP system and leveraged that to build an advanced and interactive product e-catalog. This helped the auto manufacturer: For most businesses, their inventory is spread across multiple locations – warehouses, distribution centers, retail locations, and others. Inventory availability across multiple locations can be the secret ingredient that gives businesses an edge in implementing affordable and efficient shipping solutions. Improve Product Discovery The improved product catalog enabled customers to discover new products easily and quickly, reducing the on-field sales effort. Drive Sales The product relationship information helped in identifying cross-selling opportunities and thereby driving sales. Build Efficient Operations The eCommerce ERP integration enabled the merchant to manage all product information from one system. Enhance Product Search The interactive and information-rich product images enabled customers to find the right product easily and quickly. Increase Product Understanding A bird’s-eye view of the products and related components gave customers a better understanding of the products. Improve eCommerce Adoption The ease of browsing and shopping online enabled the manufacturer to onboard B2B customers effortlessly. In addition, the eCommerce store served as a self-service customer/ dealer portal.

Continue reading to find out how an eCommerce brand worked with i95Dev to develop an ERP-integrated purchase order management solution to track, manage, and optimize purchase orders — keeping their business in control and operations efficient. Read more What is Purchase Order Management? Purchase Order Management is the process of creating, tracking, and managing purchase orders from initial request to delivery. It involves coordinating with suppliers, managing order status, tracking inventory levels, and keeping financial records updated. Many organizations have processes defined to ensure standardized procurement. However, use of spreadsheets and emails as tools for communication and record keeping works only for smaller operations. For growing and larger organizations, these can create confusion and cause delays. For eCommerce businesses, effective purchase order management is crucial for maintaining the right stock levels, minimizing order delays, and ensuring a seamless supply chain. With the growing complexity of inventory needs and supplier relationships, a streamlined purchase order management system automates manual tasks, reduces errors, and enhances control over the order process, resulting in better accuracy, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Key Benefits of Using a Purchase Order Management System Implementing a Purchase Order Management System can transform how you manage inventory,suppliers, and operations.

Improved Supplier Management Centralize all supplier information, including pricing, terms, and performance history. This helps streamline communication, allows for better negotiation on terms, and fosters stronger, more reliable supplier partnerships. Cost and Inventory Control By optimizing when and how you place orders, you avoid unnecessary stock levels and reduce carrying costs.

      "content": "B2B Customer Self Service Portal for eCommerce Platform | i95Dev Use Case# B2B Customers Self-Service Portal The B2B Customers Self-Service Portal is a secure, user-friendly platform that allows business clients to manage their accounts, place and track orders, view invoices, and access support—anytime, anywhere. It streamlines operations, reduces response times, and empowers customers with greater control over their interactions. Designed to improve efficiency and enhance customer satisfaction. Tell me More Challenges B2B businesses face while managing B2B buyers online B2B brands are slowly moving towards eCommerce, which needs improvement. Though the businesses are transitioning to an online method, the way B2B merchants conduct business has changed, and so has the B2B buyer behaviour and expectations. Sales Friction A poor online B2B portal with maximum dependency on the sales reps to complete a purchase, negatively impacts the buyer. Delayed Conversion The waiting time to connect to a sales representative encourages B2B buyers to consider other buying options. Inefficient Procurement The traditional rounds of quotations and approvals are not so productive and are time-consuming. Feature Mismatch eCommerce platforms fail to offer B2B-specific features as they are built to be B2C-centric originally. Digital Shift The pandemic effects are here to stay, and not many B2B buyers are willing to purchase in person. Pricing Ambiguity B2B buyers find it challenging to get the final price payable due to complex pricing structure. A Berkshire Hathaway Company has been the world’s most trusted uniform manufacturer for public safety since 1842. Based in Cincinnati, Ohio, the B2B & B2C company deals with standardized men’s uniforms, developed for the first time in American history for more than 175 years. Fechheimer had an online store. However, it was only equipped to showcase the huge product catalog it inherited for years. They lacked a full-fledged eCommerce store for doing business and, most importantly, a B2B self-service-oriented portal. Collaborating with i95Dev i95Dev’s B2B and eCommerce experts conducted a step-by-step discovery session and found many loopholes resisting their growth. The project was completed in 3 phases where i95Dev suggested: Smart Orders i95Dev developed smart eCommerce features like order edits, backorder cancellations that allowed customers to edit orders after they placed, cancel the complete or partial order, etc. Dynamic Pricing Fechheimer had a complex pricing model that confused B2B buyers. i95Dev customized Magento to auto-calculate and display the final price based on customer-specific factors like loyalty, order quantity, and shipping address. ERP Upgrade Due to Dynamics AX ERP’s limited usage and outdated features, i95Dev recommended switching to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations. This ensured better compatibility and performance for Fechheimer’s new Magento stores. ERP Integration Secondly, i95Dev integrated Dynamics AX ERP with the newly developed Magento stores. Store Development B2B and B2C Magento eStore development, where top eCommerce functionalities were implemented Advantages of collaborating with us Partnering with us means access to expert support, cutting-edge tools, and streamlined multi-channel solutions. We help you save time, reduce hassle, and grow your sales efficiently across all major platforms. Autonomous Purchasing Fechheimer’s B2B customers are happy with the new self-service B2B buying portal, which needs close to zero human intervention. Digital Reinvention Magento B2B and B2C stores gave the brand a new face in the highly digitalized world. Automated Efficiency The ERP integration and upgrade lead to increased productivity by automation. Customer Magnet Fechheimer is topping the game of customer satisfaction and successfully attracting more customers than ever before.

Yet despite these efforts, many B2B buyers still describe their online experience as feeling like a B2C website wearing a corporate badge : one-size-fits-all pricing, open catalogs, generic “sign up” forms, and no financial visibility beyond order history. The problem isn’t that B2B companies don’t care about digital transformation. The problem is that most digital commerce platforms fail to reflect the complexity of real-world B2B relationships – relationships built on negotiated pricing, authorized product access, contractual commitments, account hierarchies, and long-term trust. And that’s where the personalization mandate becomes unavoidable: B2B commerce must evolve from a generic storefront into a digital execution layer of business contracts, pricing rules, access control, and financial governance. Because in B2B, personalization is not about marketing. It is about operational truth. When that execution fails, everything else breaks. The Expectation Gap: What Buyers Want vs. What They Experience B2B buyers expect digital channels to let them do everything they already do offline – but faster, more accurately, and without needing a sales rep to validate pricing or eligibility. They expect contract pricing they can rely on, access only to products they are allowed to buy, onboarding that reflects who they are, and a financial portal where they can see and pay invoices without waiting for email exchanges. But what they often encounter is a storefront that treats them like strangers. This disconnect is what quietly destroys digital adoption. When customers see the wrong price, the wrong product, or an incomplete financial picture, they stop trusting what the platform shows them and revert to manual ordering channels. The result is not just an inconvenience – it’s lost efficiency, frustrated buyers, internal friction, and ultimately lost business. And until digital channels mirror the intelligence and nuance of offline commercial relationships, B2B digital transformation will continue to fall short of its promise. Where the Personalization Breakdown Really Happens If the need for personalization in B2B commerce is so clear, why do so many organizations still struggle to deliver it? It’s common to blame platform limitations or integration challenges, but the deeper issue is architectural. Most commerce platforms were designed for consumer simplicity, not contract complexity. They assume uniform pricing, universal catalogs, and straightforward checkout flows—exactly the opposite of how B2B businesses operate. ERPs, on the other hand, are built to manage that complexity: pricing matrices, discount groups, buying groups, brand restrictions, account codes, approval workflows. Yet when ERP and eCommerce interpret rules differently, the digital experience falls apart. That misalignment leads to the symptoms customers feel every day: incorrect prices online, access to products they should never see, onboarding delays, and no financial visibility. Not because businesses don’t understand personalization, but because their systems weren’t built to execute it. Until digital commerce is architected to honor the rules already living in the ERP, personalization will remain superficial rather than operational. The Real Cost of Getting Personalization Wrong When personalization breaks in B2B commerce, it is rarely noticed first inside IT or operations. It’s noticed by the customer, the moment something doesn’t align with what they know to be true. A buyer logs into the portal and sees a price that contradicts their negotiated agreement. A regional distributor sees premium products they’re prohibited from selling. A purchasing manager can’t access invoices or payment history and must call accounting for help. Each of these moments sends the same message: the digital channel can’t be trusted . And in B2B, trust is currency. Once a buyer loses confidence in the portal, they revert to human channels – emails, phone calls, sales reps, spreadsheets – and the intended benefits of digital transformation disappear. What should be a frictionless, automated, scalable model collapses back into manual effort. Order accuracy declines, costs increase, and sales teams become order processors instead of business advisors. Beyond operational inefficiency, the risk becomes commercial. Incorrect pricing can trigger disputes, credit adjustments, and margin erosion. Poor catalog governance can create channel conflict, damaging dealer ecosystems built over years. In industries governed by compliance or distribution territories, it can even become a legal or contractual liability. A single unauthorized SKU can sour a channel relationship years in the making. A single pricing discrepancy can jeopardize an enterprise account. A single onboarding failure can send a customer back to a competitor. So, while the failure may appear technical on the surface, the consequences are profoundly relational and financial. The cost is not the feature gap itself, it’s the erosion of loyalty, repeat business, and long-term revenue confidence. The risk isn’t losing a cart checkout. It’s losing the customer relationship. In B2B commerce, personalization isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s the backbone of digital trust. Without trust, customers won’t use digital channels, and without adoption, transformation fails. How to Know If Your Digital Platform Is Failing Personalization The breakdown of personalization is not always obvious from the inside. Systems appear to be working, data is syncing, orders are flowing, and the platform reports look healthy. But the clearest indicators surface not in dashboards, but in customer behavior and feedback. When buyers repeatedly bypass the portal or question what they see online, the problem is already active. Here are some of the most telling signs, each rooted in real customer experience scenarios: One of your long-standing distributor accounts logs in and immediately calls their sales rep because the pricing online doesn’t match their contracted rates. They want to confirm whether the number on the screen is a mistake. Impact: This indicates a breakdown in contract-based pricing execution, and once customers stop trusting the accuracy of pricing in your portal, they stop using it for transactions altogether . A buyer from a protected region contacts support after seeing a premium product they shouldn’t have access to. They’re confused, and worse, a preferred dealer finds out and raises concerns with your channel management team. Impact: This is a failure of catalog governance and can escalate into channel conflict or contractual disputes . A corporate purchasing manager attempts to register online but finds only a basic, consumer-style form. It doesn’t recognize their account code, route for approval, or capture the structure of their organization. They abandon onboarding and message their sales representative instead. Impact: This signals weak onboarding flows that ignore account structures and validation logic. A finance controller asks your AR team for invoice copies, payment status, and outstanding balance information because none of it exists in the digital portal. Impact: This reflects the absence of financial self-service, which eliminates one of the primary operational benefits of B2B eCommerce. Or the simplest and most important sign of all – your customers keep placing orders through email and phone even though your portal is available. When your digital channel becomes a reference tool instead of a transaction channel, personalization has failed. These symptoms are not feature requests. They are signals that customers do not trust what they see online. And without trust, digital adoption stagnates, operational efficiency stalls, and the expected ROI from transformation dissolves. How Leading B2B Organizations Are Solving the Personalization Challenge For organizations that have successfully transformed their digital channels into trusted, contract-aware experiences, the turning point came when they stopped treating eCommerce as a standalone storefront and leveraged information they already had in their systems effectively. Instead of forcing complex B2B rules into a simplified retail structure, they redesigned the digital experience to reflect the operational truth of how they already do business offline. This transformation is possible only when ERP intelligence, customer logic, and eCommerce experience are orchestrated together. That’s where i95Dev specializes: aligning digital storefront behavior with real contractual rules. In partnerships with organizations like AirGlobal, Fechheimer, EarthCore Industries, Trimax Mowers , and others, we help teams build digital experiences customers trust, because they reflect the reality of business. Challenge 1: Incorporating Complex B2B Pricing Context – B2B organizations often rely on multi-layered ERP pricing logic – contract-based discounts, pricing journals, customer/item combinations, rule priorities, and incremental adjustments. Generic tier-pricing can’t reflect this complexity. Solution – i95Dev interprets and orchestrates ERP pricing logic across every layer—discount groups, pricing agreements, item codes, increments, and priority rules. By transforming ERP pricing structures into personalized, account-based storefront pricing, we ensure each B2B buyer sees accurate, real-time contract pricing without manual overrides. Automated validation checkpoints prevent mismatched or outdated prices from ever reaching the storefront. Impact – Businesses eliminate pricing disputes, reduce manual quote corrections, and build trust by displaying accurate contract pricing for every customer. Buyers gain a reliable digital channel that reflects their negotiated terms, resulting in higher order volume and platform adoption. Case Study – Take AirGlobal, for example. Their buyers relied on complex trade agreement pricing structures in Dynamics ERP system, involving layered discount and priority rules that their eCommerce platform did not support. By extending their Magento/ Adobe Commerce store to incorporate this logic and presenting accurate, contract-specific pricing to each buyer, AirGlobal eliminated price discrepancies and restored trust. Orders increasingly shifted online because customers could finally rely on what they saw. Challenge 2: Managing Catalog Visibility Context – Many B2B organizations must restrict product visibility based on authorized brands, customer levels, buying groups, or regional contracts. Standard eCommerce platforms lack the logic to enforce these constraints. Solution – i95Dev builds catalog governance layers that replicate ERP controls inside the storefront. Attributes such as allowed brands, product families, or buying group rules are synced and applied dynamically – filtering categories, hiding restricted SKUs, and shaping the storefront experience in real time. Impact – Channel conflict is eliminated, contractual obligations are protected, and customers only view products they are authorized to purchase. This creates cleaner navigation, reduces ordering errors, and aligns digital access with offline agreements. Case Study – Fechheimer faced a different challenge – product access. Their business demanded rigorous control over which brands and items different customer groups could purchase. By integrating catalog governance rules directly from the ERP into the storefront experience, they ensured buyers only saw the products they were authorized to buy. The result was reduced channel conflict and a more streamlined, intuitive purchasing journey. Earthcore Industries needed something similar. They were able to maintain channel integrity by tailoring product visibility to different buying groups. Challenge 3: Customer Onboarding Context – Unlike B2C, B2B onboarding requires business verification, ERP account matching, approval workflows, and customer-type routing. A single “create account” form cannot support this complexity. Solution – i95Dev designs intelligent B2B registration flows with company-type routing (e.g., dealer vs. end customer), ERP account validation, and automated or manual approval processes. New account codes are generated when needed, while existing customers can link their ERP accounts seamlessly. Impact – Onboarding becomes efficient, predictable, and aligned with ERP customer structures. Sales and support teams spend significantly less time manually vetting registrations, and customers experience a professional, enterprise-grade process. Case Study – Similarly, Trimax Mowers transformed onboarding with an intelligent registration system that verifies account codes, routes approvals, and connects to ERP accounts. Across these examples, the common outcome is clear: trust increased, digital adoption accelerated, and operational efficiency improved – not because new features were added, but because the platform finally reflected the business relationship it was built to support. The lesson is simple: when B2B personalization becomes operational, not cosmetic, digital commerce becomes a growth engine instead of a transactional website. Why Personalization Requirements Differ Across B2B Industries While the core principle of B2B personalization is universal – aligning digital experience with real contractual relationships – the way this requirement manifests varies significantly across industries. Each vertical operates under unique commercial models, distribution structures, and governance expectations, which shape what “personalized” must mean in practice. Manufacturing: Manufacturers rely heavily on controlled dealer and distributor networks where product access and territory protection are critical. Personalization here is about enforcing authorization rules with precision, ensuring specific customers can only view and purchase the products, brands, and configurations they are contractually entitled to. Any deviation risks channel conflict and long-term relationship damage. Distribution & Wholesale: Distributors operate under highly complex pricing and discount structures tied to volume commitments, product families, customer groups, and negotiated terms. For them, personalization lives primarily in pricing accuracy : digitally executing layered ERP pricing logic in real time. When pricing fails, margins disappear, making personalization a financial safeguard rather than a customer experience enhancement. Retail & Specialty Retail with B2B Buyers: Retailers that support both consumer and wholesale buyers require dual digital models within one platform. Personalization means clear segmentation: consumer storefronts optimized for browsing and marketing, and B2B portals driven by contract pricing, minimum order rules, and portal-only catalogs. The risk here is confusion – if wholesale buyers see consumer pricing or irrelevant product sets, the portal loses credibility immediately. B2B Services, Training & Compliance Organizations: For service-led businesses, personalization centers on onboarding and account controls rather than catalog or pricing. Approval flows, account hierarchies, entitlement rules, subscription lifecycle controls, and financial self-service capabilities determine whether customers can engage efficiently. If onboarding breaks, revenue stalls. Despite these differences, the strategic takeaway is the same: Personalization is not a single feature. It is the digital execution of each industry’s commercial model. Organizations that understand this distinction architect their digital platforms to respect their business logic rather than working around it, and that’s where true competitive advantage emerges. The Path Forward B2B eCommerce was never meant to be a storefront. It is a relationship platform – a space where trust, pricing, access, and accountability all converge. The companies gaining real ROI from digital commerce are the ones who begin not with features, but with fidelity to the customer relationship. If your eCommerce store adoption is poor, your platform isn’t broken. It’s simply not personalized. Delivering true personalization in B2B commerce requires rethinking the foundational architecture that links ERP, eCommerce, and customer-facing digital experiences. This requires a shift to a model where the ERP acts as the authoritative brain and the commerce platform becomes the execution layer. ERP remains the single source of truth for pricing, customer attributes, financial data, and product governance. eCommerce is re-architected as a real-time interpreter , orchestrating ERP rules instead of duplicating or approximating them. Data flows become bi-directional and intelligence-driven , rather than nightly batch uploads or manual updates. Personalization is applied dynamically , based on the attributes and logic already defined in the ERP, not recreated manually. Governance replaces customization , reducing dependency on fragile workarounds that accumulate over time. The outcome is more than a smoother experience. It is a platform where customers confidently rely on digital because it behaves exactly like the business relationship they already know. The true value of personalization is not in convenience. It is in strengthening the commercial relationship. Trust drives adoption. Adoption drives efficiency. Efficiency drives scalable growth. Conclusion Personalization in B2B is no longer a competitive differentiator. It is a commercial requirement. Without it, digital channels fail to earn trust, and without trust, they fail to drive adoption or revenue. At i95Dev, we help organizations bridge the gap between ERP, business rules, and digital experience to make personalization real, not theoretical. Our role is part engineering, part workflow strategy, and part commercial alignment – ensuring technology reflects the truth of how the organization operates.

      "content": "Adobe Commerce Integration Starter Kit Comprehensive Guide | i95Dev Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Adobe Commerce Integration Starter Kit Author Category Share Adobe continues to add more features and capabilities to deliver faster and more personalized commerce experiences for consumers and business buyers by investing in composable development tools and AI-powered personalization. They recently launched the Adobe Commerce Integration Starter Kit to facilitate seamless data sharing between third-party systems like ERP, OMS, & CRM and lower the cost of ownership for integrations and customizations. Laying the foundation with App Builder In January 2023, Adobe introduced Adobe Developer App Builder to transform how businesses’ implementation of Adobe Commerce. App Builder for Adobe Commerce delivered core capabilities across the entire development stack, including headless commerce, using API Mesh, event-based data routing between Adobe Commerce and external systems using Events, extension (rather than customization) of Adobe Commerce using Webhooks and extension of Adobe Commerce admin via Admin UI SDK. These capabilities are delivered in a serverless computing environment to enable developers to easily build apps and integrations, while Adobe handles provisioning, scaling, and security of the App Builder infrastructure. Pre-built ERP integrations to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and SAP S/4HANA Integrating eCommerce with third-party systems is a critical requirement. Adobe Commerce introduced an integration starter kit for back-office integrations using Adobe Developer App Builder to reduce the time to market, the cost of integrating with ERP systems and improve reliability of real-time connections. Key Features A standardized, pre-defined architecture that follows commerce extensibility best practices. A reference implementation of the most common integrations with an external back-office application (products, customers, orders, stock, and shipments) Onboarding scripts to reduce the manual steps associated with connecting Adobe Commerce to external back-office applications (e.g., ERP). Later this year, Adobe will release pre-built integrations to two common ERPs, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and SAP S/4 HANA, using the integration starter kit. These integrations focus on synchronizing five commonly used objects including: Product, Customer, Stock, Order, and Shipment. Developers can easily customize these reference integrations to meet the business’s needs. The starter kit is expected to reduce integration effort by up to 50%, lowering the time to market and the cost of integrations. Note: The starter kit is available for Adobe Commerce clients through the App Builder and inaccessible to Magento Open-Source customers. Our Assessment of Adobe Commerce Integration Starter Kit Adobe Commerce Integration Starter Kit is a good initial framework for basic integration needs. However, it may require expertise, experience, and effort to meet businesses’ more complex integration needs. On further analysis, we found that the Starter Kit lacks several critical features like: Logging capabilities, Integration status display, Error notifications, Automatic retry mechanisms in case of failure, Performance management during bulk updates, Payment and shipping method mapping, and more. Additionally, while Adobe Commerce events are pre-integrated, customers must develop and configure the corresponding ERP events. Hence, while the pre-build integrations with Dynamics 365 Finance and SAP S/4 HANA will take care of common integration data points, additional effort must be put in for additional touchpoints or customizations. For more information, explore i95Dev’s comprehensive solutions for Adobe Commerce/ Magento and Dynamics 365 Finance and Adobe Commerce/ Magento and SAP . Hence, independent integration solutions will continue to thrive, serving businesses with more extensive integration needs and business-specific requirements. Comparing i95Dev Connect with Adobe Commerce Integration Starter Kit i95Dev Connect for Adobe Commerce offers a robust set of features, including: Supports both Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source. Automatic retry in case of errors. Customizable error notifications to pre-configured email addresses. Transaction synchronization from the last successful state in case of network failure. Improved performance in case of bulk updates. Support for one-to-many integrations through the i95Dev Cloud interface. Custom Dashboards in Adobe Commerce and i95Dev Cloud. Sync existing data like products and customers. Support for advanced features like B2B Customer Accounts, Sales Quotation, Payment Terms, Bill Pay, Multi-warehouse support, Split shipment and Invoices, and more. Solution to integrated Adobe Commerce/ Magento with applications like Dynamics GP, AX, NAV, and SAGE 100, which lack APIs/ infrastructure for integration. Integration is a complex endeavor and requires expertise in both end systems to do things right. For instance, reconciling the differing pricing structures between ERP and eCommerce requires expertise in both systems to develop an effective integration solution. Adobe Commerce Integration Starter Kit can be both a boon and a bane for businesses. It can help you address common integration needs quickly and cost-effectively, if used correctly. Misused, you can spend a lot of time and money struggling to get things right. Integration Starter Kit or Out-of-box integration solutions, in both situations, it is best to let an integration expert, someone who understands both systems well, drive things for you to minimize risks and improve chances of success. Unlock seamless connectivity and elevate your eCommerce operations by leveraging i95Dev’s Integration Expertise as a Service.

On-premises: Costs include server hardware, backup systems, and software licensing. Server: $5,000 – $15,000 Backup System: ~$2,000 Software Licensing: ~$1,500 per server Cloud Hosting: Scalable monthly fee ($130 – $2,000/month) based on functionality and data needs.

Annual cost: $50 – $600 (premium options up to $1,000) Tip: Factor SSL costs into your budget if using Magento Open Source. Web Store Design/Themes: Pre-built Themes: You can look into free and paid options on Adobe Marketplace and purchase a theme for $60–$499. External Magento theme vendors and support communities: You can consider purchasing ready-made designs from third-party vendors. For instance, you can buy a theme from ThemeForest for $17 – $499. Custom-built Themes: Starting cost: $5,000. Depends on UI/UX requirements and mobile compatibility. Tip: Start with pre-built themes to minimize initial costs and consider custom themes as your store growtables.

Ready-made extensions: $0 – $10,000 Custom eCommerce development: Minimum $6,000 per add-on Tip: Budget for extensions to enhance store functionality and consider the cost of custom development if needed.

This amount covers credit card processing fees and payment platform fees. 2% – 4% per transaction value PayPal and Stripe: 2.9% transaction fee Tip: Account for transaction fees in your pricing strategy to maintain profitability. SEO and Digital Marketing: All three Magento editions include search engine optimization functionality and support marketing campaigns to some degree. Magento Open Source only includes the basic features while the other two editions offer more advanced capabilities. You will still need to hire a marketing professional for a comprehensive SEO audit and website optimization consultation. SEO Expert Consultation: Hourly Rate: $15 – $35. 20-40 working hours required. Advanced SEO Add-ons for Magento Open Source Tip: Invest in professional SEO services to maximize your store’s visibility and traffic Artificial Intelligence: Research shows that customers will spend 40% more time shopping on your website if their experience is personalized, which is a strong incentive to invest in AI.

Author Category Share Do you know, Netflix offered a whopping $1 million to anybody who could help them in improving their recommendation engine’s quality by 10%? The purpose of this experiment was just to find out ways to improve their recommendations that are provided to their end customers. But why are we talking about Netflix? We are not talking about Netflix but trying to highlight the importance of understanding the customers’ needs. Netflix tried to predict their customers and their demand in the year 2006 with this experiment. More than a decade has passed but in today’s scenario, it is even more crucial to be able to predict as accurately as possible to be relevant. With changing times and demand, the predictive analysis came to being and became crucial for every business’s decision-making process. In this article, we will tell you how it is crucial for YOUR business’ decision making too! Predictive Analysis – What is it and how does it work? Predictive analytics can be considered as a practice, which extracts relevant and useful information from the existing sets of data and helps businesses in determining patterns as well as predicting future trends and outcomes. Although the predictive analysis doesn’t predict the future accurately, it can forecast what might happen. The prediction that it does is based on acceptable levels of relatability, it includes risk-assessment and every possible what-if scenarios. Businesses have started to cultivate the landscape of predictive analysis because of its predictions help deliver the value perceived by the customer. More computing power, more storage, and more data! Massive repositories of customer interactions that you have are potential raw source material. These are used to establish a pattern in customers’ behavior patterns with predictive analytics. When you realize it – the accessibility of data and the collected data helps the implementation of predictive analysis. Then as almost every business has sound computing power, it made the implementation of predictive analysis faster, easier, and more correct. In easier words, the predictive analysis doesn’t work on some foreign sophisticated system, it works with your system and data. No wonder, almost every company started to interact more with their customers. Let us take a deeper dive and understand the process of predictive analytics. Predictive analytics – the process Project definition This where the project is defined – the outcomes, identification of the data sets, business objectives, scope, and deliverable. This step enables you to approach the project with clear intents and objectives. Collection of data This is when the process starts and it starts with the preparation of the data from various sources. The process of data mining can take a little longer than expected, but this is the backbone of the entire process. Data analysis The process of modeling, cleaning, and inspecting data is data analysis. The main objective of data analysis is to discover useful information, which will be ultimately used in the decision-making process. Statistical analysis The statistical analysis validates the assumptions that are made during and after the data analysis. Further, statistical analysis validates and test every hypothesis using standard models of statistics. Predictive modeling The predictive modeling offers the ability to create predictive future models that are close to being accurate. The predictive modeling can also help you understand in assessing future scenarios based on today’s trends. Predictive model deployment The predictive model deployment will provide you the option of deploying the analytical results that you gathered from all the previous processes. You can deploy the analytical findings into the present process of decision making. Model monitoring This is a process that will come in only if you have deployed the predictive model. The models will be monitored and managed to review the performance of the model and make sure that you are getting results. Which decisions can you take with predictive analysis? We understand you want it to predict everything! Who wouldn’t? The predictive analysis will give you predictions based on accurate studies and statistics. Therefore, the chances of them being true are pretty high. With the data and information that you will get from predictive analysis, you can take a lot of decisions easily. Here are a few instances: Which advertising can prove to be most effective? Which marketing campaigns channels and campaigns, as well as customer demographics and behaviors, can contribute to your existing business outcome? Modeling which campaign will work best for a particular business problem How many leads converted with your existing strategies? Based on the finding, you can decide or modify your strategies. The longevity of customers based on their past behavior and purchase history? The list can go much longer. Time to turn data into predictions! There is no longer ”insufficient data!” The limitation has faded and it’s time to make the most of your data and predict the future with the predictive analysis. Based on the findings, you can make a decision and when you have numbers with accurate evidence to back them, decision making becomes much easier and better. i95Dev has helped numerous clients implement their strategies.

      "content": "How Magento BI Enhances Product Specific Analysis? Author Category Share In our day-to-day lives we use thousands of products, right from a toothpaste in the morning to the processed foods for a quick dinner. Do you think all these products were originally launched in the market only due to the change in human needs? You might answer, yes, of course! However, we would say that you are partially correct. You must be thinking, why are we saying so? It is because, most of the times, it is not the need of the people, but the brand itself creating a need for a particular product in the market! This is not a practice of the recent times, but it has been passed on from one generation to another. Before launching a new product or a service in the market or to make modifications to it, there is a lot of background work done on it. And that background work is product specific analysis that requires analysis and study on every aspect of the product and surrounding conditions. How product specific analysis helps? Product specific analysis helps in the following: Understanding the users with product specific analysis: Who the users are? What they need? How to retain them? Decision making : Material Processing Economic Geographic regions Time Aesthetic decisions, etc. Benefits of Product specific analysis with Magento BI: Price Management To introduce any product in the market, first the selling price is fixed. A lot of effort is put in to finalize it, right from profiling your competitive landscape to market pricing analysis and so on. Magento BI helps you turn all the raw competitor data to facts and reports that help you decide the pricing of the product to be launched. It also automates the extensive market analysis for different market conditions and geographies. In addition, Magento BI benefits you in analyzing the target audience and their buyer behavior. Identification of product’s market potential You definitely don’t want to launch a product before knowing its market potential right? And you also are aware of the hard work it takes through the process of conducting the market potential analysis for a product. Following are categories to be analysed for identifying a product’s market potential: Sales performance of the existing products (same product line) Current market activity Identify user’s identify Magento BI simplifies your work by analysing all the data you already have in the repository and transform it in such a way that can generate results to numerous such queries within seconds. Forecast sales volume Magento BI enables you to analyse the customer needs as well as size the existing customer base. This helps you to estimate the volume of the sales that you are expected to make. Not just that, it also helps you to identify the break-even point and provides you an estimate of how safe your product launch is in order to recover your investment. Forecast of the sales volume also plays a vital role at the time of seasonal offers and discount. During this time, proper analysis of the price management and its estimation of returns is absolutely necessary. Forecast of the lifespan of the product The fact that ‘no product can rule the market forever’ is clear out there. Every product in the market has a certain amount of lifespan after which its need among the users starts fading followed by irrelevancy at some point. This majorly happens due to the ever changing technology and innovations in today’s world. Using Magento BI, forecasting the lifespan of the products becomes an easy job as it estimates the market future market conditions and other activities simultaneously. Scope of marketing strategy Planning a marketing strategy is as important as conducting any other analysis for the product. Designing a marketing strategy comes with a lot of market research and raw data associated with it. Magento BI collates and analyses all such raw data and transforms it in such a way that helps you design an effective marketing strategy and therefore helps in decision making. Customer feedback analysis You arrive at a full-fledged product only after repeated improvements, and these improvements are made based on the customer feedback received . Through this process, there are a lot of customer needs and frustrations that come forward. Sorting the data that is not received in a uniformed manner is a huge task and it’s even more exhausting to make sense out of it. Magento BI works wonders in places like customer feedback analysis. It sorts all the raw data available, arranges in a particular format and produces automated reports that can be used in decision making. How can i95Dev help?

      "content": "Pharma companies impacted by COVID-19: i95Dev comes to the rescue Pharma companies impacted by COVID-19:i95Dev comes to the rescue Author Category Share COVID-19 has shaken the world to the core. The coronavirus pandemic hasn’t spared any industry. Most of the companies are redesigning and redefining their businesses while others with more stability are fighting tooth and claw. At a time when large businesses are incurring huge losses and SMBs are heading for the hills, many of the online pharma companies are witnessing a significant jump in sales riding on the back of panic buying and stocking up. According to a recent survey , the pharmaceutical brick and mortar stores are facing commotions while pharma eCommerce is expecting a long-term benefit but at the cost of temporary losses. These losses are a result of changed consumer behaviour and disrupted supply chain. Pharma companies impacted by COVID-19: AstraZeneca (AZ) has witnessed a revenue downturn as most of its business generates in China where the COVID-19 outbroke. To make things worse, coronavirus has severely impacted economies of the US and Europe from where AstraZeneca fostered another major chunk of its sales. However, ecommerce has saved the day for AZ to some extent but not in a notable manner. AZ is making an attempt to come up with a vaccine for the virus by collaborating with Sanofi. Along with its ecommerce sales, this project might help the company recover its loss. Novartis, on the other hand, has made a killing out of forward buying as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The company has nurtured sales worth 400 million dollars in its first quarter. According to the company, much of the impact did not come from wholesaler stockpiling but it came from ecommerce, longer prescriptions, and filling of prescriptions early by patients. Merck & Co. is expecting a 2.1 billion dollars dip in 2020 sales due to the coronavirus pandemic. The primary reason behind the fall is sales is reduced office visits by doctors. Albeit, the sales of Keytruda (a drug that sells like a hotcake) continued to run strong in the first quarter, Merck is anticipating a massive drop in sales in the second quarter. The company received some relief from its online sales where customers have been stocking up on products like animal healthcare medicines. Pfizer recorded an increase in revenue on the grounds of jump in ecommerce sales of its pneumonia vaccine (Prevnar 13). The serious cases of COVID-19 causes pneumonia with high death rates. Prevnar 13 comes handy in such cases. The company is expecting a further rise in revenue based on creating a vaccine for the pandemic by collaborating with BioNTech. In the first quarter, Johnson & Johnson’s sales in the medical device unit dipped by around 8 percent. Its pharma unit saw a surge of over 8 percent driven by ecommerce sales of cancer drugs. In addition, the company’s consumer health unit witnessed its sales jump by 9 percent due to demand for products in pain drugs as a result of panic buying. Many of the offline pharma companies having physical stores only suffered severe losses due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Realising the urgency to go digital, most of these companies are now expanding their customer reach by shifting online. However, ecommerce too has its shortcomings like supply chain disruptions, increase in overall demand, shortage of drugs, delayed deliveries, cancelled orders, product safety concerns, price gouging, cybersecurity threats, development-related challenges, requirement for increased bandwidth, false practices, and more. How to overcome these challenges? i95Dev comes to your rescue! For the offline pharma companies – i95Dev offers: Magento Solution packages – We will build an ecommerce store for you from scratch within 8 weeks. https://www.i95dev.com/magento-packages/ For the online pharma companies – i95Dev offers: EGE solution – This is our unique solution not possessed by anyone in the industry.

In the same manner, the online pharma retailers can use this solution to expand their supply base by reaching out to multiple pharma manufacturers.

      "content": "Adobe Commerce 2.4.4: moving above and beyond Magento | i95Dev Adobe Commerce 2.4.4: moving above and beyond magento Author Category Share So Magento got another update this month, but it’s more than a regular update- it’s a brand overhaul with some decent updates to the eCommerce platform’s underpinnings. Adobe purchased the Magento Ecommerce Edition in May 2018, and it recently rebranded it as Adobe Commerce, a move that impacts over 189,062 websites. ( Image Credits ) The experts at i95Dev have curated this blog to help our readers understand the dynamics behind this rebranding exercise. Let’s get started: Adobe Commerce Cloud 2.4.4 Addresses Multiple Security Concerns The new release includes patches for three security improvements and bug fixes each apart from security enhancements across the platform through a core codebase upgrade. Also, it includes security benefits like: As a result of security improvisation, session IDs will no longer be stored in the database. Non-alpha-numeric file extensions uploading will also become more secure as validation is fortified. The coupon codes, too, will get additional support from reCAPTCHA. Swagger will be disabled by default. Access and password reset tokens will also get encrypted when stored in the database. Also, these security patches are backported to Adobe Commerce 2.4.3-p2 and Adobe Commerce 2.3.7-p3 versions. Performance And Scalability Enhancements Order validation and cart operations have been optimized for enabling smoother checkout and fulfillment. Also, you will be able to process the orders at a quicker pace, making the overall user experience better for both you and your customers. AsyncOrder feature will allow you to process orders in the background while your customers are finishing their checkout. You can now enable inventory check for products added to carts. You can now allow multiple customers to perform various processes in parallel by adding multiple_processes configuration to your app/etc/env.php file for better task execution speed. With hundreds of variable products, carts can now be processed quickly with memory limit expansions. PayPal Enhancements Merchants will now benefit from the built-in Venmo payment inside Paypal. Based on geotargeting, customers can now choose to “Pay Later.” The customers will be explicitly notified regarding the charges associated with the “Pay Later” option on the checkout page. ( Image Credits ) Accessibility Updates Screen reader support is updated for all relevant Product Page elements. Readability is enhanced for low vision users through measures like improved contrast and icon relocation. It will become easier to navigate on the Cart and Checkout pages. The magnifying glass (used for searching products) will get a text-based alternative and an accessible name. Cart Enhancements The “Advertised Minimum Price” link is fixed and now clickable. It redirects the user towards an information popup. Earlier, Adobe Commerce displayed a ‘Payment Error’ message after a ‘Payment Error’ message which is now eliminated. If the increased shopping cart product quantity is deemed invalid, the value will be restored to the previous figure to maintain checkout page performance. Platform Enhancements Composer dependencies, including JS libraries like RequireJS, are upgraded to bring the platform to par with PHP 8.1 On top of that, support has been provided for TinyMCE 5, and PHPUnit is upgraded to 9.5.x Page Builder Enhancements Text editor issues faced while working on banner content are optimized along with table fonts. Popup windows like ‘Insert/Edit image’ and ‘Insert/Edit Link’ are now positioned better. The page builder is expected to receive more frequent updates in the future as it is one of the focus areas of Adobe at the moment. Additional Enhancements You can now successfully add Product Videos through the path Admin Catalog > Products > Add Video. Also, the save button will be enabled when an incomplete URL is added, while the additional fields will get auto-filled. The timestamps will now be converted into the user’s time zone in the export filename. Previously, this wasn’t possible, and Adobe only displayed the UTC timestamp. Adobe Commerce will not generate duplicate images in its remote storage upon importing CSV files multiple times. Why You Must Upgrade To Adobe Commerce 2.4.4 ASAP Despite being around for more than two decades, eCommerce is rapidly evolving while customer behavior is now augmented at a much higher rate. Using the latest version of Adobe Ecommerce will help you on multiple fronts, including the support for PHP 8.1, while you will also benefit from: Better integration with Adobe Experience Cloud applications. Better tools for your Adobe Ecommerce developers. Improved ability to customize your Adobe eCommerce store along with enhanced flexibility. Maintenance also becomes quicker and more affordable than the old (Magento) versions. Summing Up It is noteworthy that despite the rebranding, Magento Open Source, i.e., Magento Community Edition, will continue to exist as earlier. The updates in the latest version make a strong case for users to upgrade as they also help solve some of the persistent problems faced in the earlier versions. If you are facing any troubles upgrading from older Magento versions to Adobe Commerce 2.4.4, feel free to reach out to us anytime. Feel Free to get in touch with i95Dev today! If you are facing any troubles upgrading from older Magento versions to Adobe Commerce 2.4.4 How did i95Dev’s project management team help overcome our inventory sync issue.

      "content": "B2B eCommerce Customer Experience – An Action Plan Author Category Share Sally’s long week at work ended with binge watching her favorite series on TV drowned in a bucket of popcorn. She lazes around all weekend working her way through her favorite shopping sites, buying stuff she had been procrastinating for a while. Sally relaxed and feels thoroughly accomplished and pumped to start the new month ahead at work on Monday. Sally has worked hard, is now beginning to reap the fruits of a successful business set up a few years ago. She goes early to work on Monday, gets ready to order the customary supplies for the month ahead. So what do you think Sally was going to do? Call the vendor who she always struggles to catch hold of at that early hour? Go hunting in her practically paperless office for catalogs to order from? Or call around peers for help on good deals? For all you know she probably wants break convention. Get over with a simple mundane routine bulk order. Sally will look for that convenient B2B ecommerce customer experience that helped her get rid of her personal shopping chores successfully over the weekend. Will she find what she wants? The rise in expectations of a B2B buyer If you thought that an average B2B buyer today stuck to convention, as a B2B brand owner this is probably your first step towards gross negligence. Forrester said that B2B ecommerce market is estimated at $1.1 trillion compared to the B2C market, which is at $480 billion. The accelerated growth of B2B ecommerce is only justified however; for the buying community here overlaps with B2C where superior evolved buying experiences reign. B2B buyers today are therefore aware; they are clear needs for online simply because they are aware of the B2C space. So now Sally would prefer to ideally help herself online with simple self-serve online portal as against looking calling a vendor negotiating prices and the regular rigmarole from there. A robust B2B portal would help sally find more information, note fine print, research, buy and further manage her accounts from there. All right you do realize that your audiences are out there waiting for you to put up your best show yet. Unsure if you can still succeed? Here is what you may have likely overlooked. To meet your B2B customer expectations and overcome specific challenges, watch this insightful webinar. click here Common B2B misconceptions It is but a fact that B2B businesses are yet to realize the complete potential of ecommerce; now this could be due to several reasons. The leadership rung still believes that not only implementing ecommerce is expensive but all that follows remains complex with costs riding over a projected revenue gain. While this stands at the base what follows are a series of other mistakes B2B brands commit in their endeavor to succeed online. The B2B buyer is yet to mature. But of course you are dealing with the new generation buyer whose powers and preferences you cannot fathom completely yet. But you do know that their preferred method of transacting has surpassed the conventional processes and for the nth time as we insist, they have stepped in from the B2C realm. Bear in mind that almost all the winning features of B2C can be translated into B2B thereby dramatically influencing customer experiences. B2B Ecommerce will reveal the pricing structure. With the growth rate in B2B we have just mentioned above, cut throat pricing techniques margins hitting new lows simply to gain a bigger chunk of buyers are inevitable. While caution to safeguard pricing techniques cannot be compromised, a web store front will not snatch your privacy away. Web stores can offer the option of viewing prices when the buyer logs in. While this not only restricts customers viewing the entire pricing structure, access can also be restricted to showcasing the applicable and negotiated pricing for a specific user. The B2B site can also be simply to allow product visibility enable product visibility for those without a login and encourage them to call for prices. B2B ecommerce does not foster long term relationships Long term relationship with the B2B buyer is conventional; for there are bulk and repeat orders that occur periodically. Forging strong B2B bonds also ensures that competition is not a threat really, with “deals” closed over dinner’s visits and trips by family owned businesses. Web stores can still be transformed with live 24*7 chats, presence on social media or a variety of other options to connect. With this, customer service is a lot more continued and moreover is welcomed by the B2B community at large. B2B ecommerce is incapable of handling custom orders A custom order mostly based on the longevity of the relationship is most often perceived to be against the ecommerce norm. Let us say that you work with a Magento B2B setup, there are add-ons or extensions, tools and variants that can be incorporated. Sales quote for Magento is a classic example of such a tool that allows creation of online quotes straight from the shopping cart. Scalability is not feasible with B2B ecommerce Building a highly scalable B2B platform is more often pushed to the back burner by B2B brands. Brands build shopping cart platforms without too much thought into the future despite having an aggressive growth agenda on the cards. This directly impacts ecommerce functionality at each stage of growth ultimately coming in the way of the company’s ability to scale its platform. Above all B2B firms direct focus on to beating direct competitors, when the actual market is hogged by the massive online marketplaces such as Amazon, Google, eBay and Alibaba. These giants have already established and transformed B2C buying experiences that is slowly steadily catching up on B2B as well. After all the B2B buyer already familiar, they use their sites apps and completely is at home with all interfaces. They know that no matter what his expectations will be met by them. Sally is no exception. Evolved B2B ecommerce customer experience – Here is your 7 point action plan It is imperative to bear in mind and keep competing with your own customer expectations; delivering exceptional online buying experience is that which can sustain your B2B selling strategy. Doing away with legacy tech infrastructure and investing in what will meet evolved customer demands will propel your brand towards a win each time. Make B2B ecommerce an informed reassuring buying experience Your content is indeed the lifeline of your B2B ecommerce experience . With missing information like product sizes, ingredient lists, or demo videos, the user will simply look elsewhere. This simply leads to the customer choosing another purchase funnel outside of your own. Today B2B user experiences mean ability to obtain detailed information and ability to track real time data on products and services made available. If it means deploying a robust product information management system in the B2B portal, it is about time B2B brands thought about it. Free unrestricted information exchange establish trust and then this way the deal can be closed out faster. Focus on offline to online shift Millennial buyers are about efficiency and speed in transactions; the chances of speaking to a sales representative or using a phone to close out a sale is slowly decreasing. On the contrary the chances of a purchase during a service call by the sales representative are pretty much growing. With adequate publicity on the launch of an ecommerce channel, you can even drive your most valued customers into preliminary testing so as to train, educate, and gain valuable feedback. Leverage the ability to nurture leads through the B2B buying journey A typical B2B buyer journey is long and therefore there exists a bigger window to explore potential to sell more to the same buyer in the process. Rich content in the form of informative material related to the product help consumers make informed decisions, establishing communication after first level information is shared helps hit the iron when it is hot. The buyer feels a lot more connected with the brand, the interest builds and also increases the chances of connecting with a sales person from there. Read our blog on how to leverage on CRM for your B2B business . Woo your Omni channel audiences According to MarketingProfs , “98% of buyers are doing at least some online research on work-related purchases that they make offline”. Today the conversion funnel ideally takes off from there, a website experience that transmit contextual consistent and accurate content is therefore imperative. The role of the B2B salesman is not redundant as yet, what is more important and sustainable is the ability to be able to complement and feed prospects into both online/offline channels. Aggregating and organizing data across applications within the business set-up will help establish an integrated system. Now this will enable uniform sharing of data which is crucial to ensure a seamless buying experiences across different channels. For more information, do read our blog on omni-channel experience in B2B ecommerce . Merge your ecommerce efforts with concurrent business processes and teams Working in tandem with all channels and support functions is that which will accelerate growth. The B2B digital channel needs to be structured and weaved into an existing set up such that it furthers the overall efforts of selling. It is therefore important to first review the current support structure, align roles and resources in line with what is expected from the digital channel. B2B mobile commerce Mobile commerce was 30% way back in 2014 and the figures have been growing ever since. B2B mobile commerce throws open a window of opportunity by means of operating outside the usual confines of a traditional desktop browser, brands can belt out push notifications, social integration, and mobile payments also addressing some unique requirements of B2B. Such as say- B2B orders are most often repeats; post the first order the likelihood of repeat orders from the same customer climbs with the help of a convenient mobile app. Usability of your B2B e-store The web UX of your B2B e store is that which drives conversion; failing which most of the time users fail to complete the website action. B2B customers today demand seamless website performance across all interfaces, customized features, self-service options in short a web experience on par with what is found on B2C.

      "content": "Adobe analytics VS Google analytics – Which is better for E-commerce? Adobe analytics VS Google analytics – Which is better for eCommerce? Author Category Share With the exception of gauging web traffic, web analytics have a significant role to play in executing e-commerce market research and assessing how a website and web store is performing. Talking in business terms, it gives you an in-depth analysis that helps you determine whether your online business is giving you a decent return on your investment and bags future prospects for better revenue generation. Every eCommerce business has different data requirements, thus, the analytics tool they make use of is dissimilar. A web analytics tool that serves your purpose perfectly is the one you should go for. This will help you acquire insightful analytics data that will guide you to make the right decisions for constant growth in times ahead. A few of the web analytics tools stand out as they are pitch-perfect in their make, insights, and accuracy. One of the renowned names is Google Analytics. It is an extremely powerful software that is available for you free of cost. The Google analytics offers an intuitive user interface, daily web traffic analysis, identification of traffic sources, identification of keyword research done by visitors, commendable engagement metrics along with a grip on conversions and conversion rates. Such an in-depth analysis of data gives you a sharp insight into customer behavior that helps you shoot your profits multitudinously. However, when it is about E-commerce websites, there is just one web analytic software that surpasses Google Analytics and steals the show – Adobe Analytics! Benefits of Adobe Analytics: Third-party integration support – Adobe Analytics has a sharply defined benefit as far as third party integration support is concerned. It flaunts a broad range of connectors for integrating with various types of the third party and Adobe tools. You have the option of importing and exporting data automatically. The export data will help you measure things like cart abandonments while the import data will give you an idea of the email metrics such as clicks, opens, and bounces. You can make use of this data for efficient remarketing. On the other hand, Google Analytics lacks this feature diversely. It faces severe challenges while connecting with third-party tools, however, data can be brought in through measurement protocol API. Thus, it will not be a one-click integration, unlike Adobe Analytics. Customer support and account management – Adobe Analytics provides you round the clock customer support and account management. In addition, it offers countless research papers, tutorials, and videos having solutions to technical problems. All of it for free! On the other hand, Google Analytics does not provide any chat or support line for resolving customer complaints. Therefore, the customer experience with Adobe Analytics is way more superior to Google Analytics. Data storage ability – For their licensed customers and clients, Adobe Analytics allows you to store data for an unlimited span of time. On the other hand, Google Analytics gives you the option of storing data for merely 2 years. In addition, Adobe Analytics stores cookies for 15 years while Google Analytics stores cookies for merely 30 days. This makes it easy for Adobe to save visit information and customer preferences. Custom Variables and Metrics – Adobe Analytics has the advantage of being extremely customizable. You can create custom events, traffic, and conversion variables. It offers specific information on individual visitors that greatly helps in identifying potential customers such as who clicked on a certain campaign or who bought a product. It allows 75 traffic variables and 100 conversion variables, along with 1000 success event metrics. On the other hand, Google Analytics merely allows 20 custom metrics and 20 custom dimensions. Pathing and Funnels – Pathing is the sequence or order of pages visited by your website users. Pathing is flexible and commendable in Adobe Analytics. In addition, Adobe analytics flaunts custom event funnels against valuable historical data. A funnel is a navigation path that you anticipate your visitors to follow for acquiring website goals. With the help of funnels, you can eradicate bottlenecks in your sales or conversion process. Talking about pathing in Google Analytics – it is atrocious! The Page Navigation Summary report works fine when you just want to see the next page or the earlier one, however, you will not be able to go beyond it. In addition, the funnels are outdated and need immediate modification. An industry expert from Analytics Demystified stated that “ Adobe Analytics has a long-standing history of extensive custom variables, the ability to do pathing on those variables pops up as being super handy when you’d least expect it.” Hits and Goals – Adobe Analytics captures endless hits per month while Google Analytics is restricted to 10 million hits every month. What’s more, you are able to track 100 goals on Adobe Analytics while merely 4 goals can be tracked on Google Analytics. Goals provide critical information such as the sales conversion rates for your website or the total number of sales conversions. Conclusion If a website witnesses a high number of variables and high web traffic, Adobe Analytics is ideal for it. To put it bluntly, mostly such sites are e-commerce websites that demand extensive custom coding so that correct values swim smoothly through an online checkout process. Adobe Analytics offers seamless integration with third-party tools which is extremely beneficial for e-commerce websites as they engage with third-party vendors and take up paid marketing initiatives on a regular basis. An industry expert who has umpteen years of experience in managing and consulting hundreds of online marketing companies and websites with millions of visitors every month and who is a former head of marketing at KISSmetrics stated – “At the e-commerce level, Adobe Analytics is the de facto winner. If my goal were to seriously up-level my analytics capabilities beyond Google Analytics, I’d go with Adobe Analytics. It’s a more complete analytics package that extends beyond the website-only focus of Google Analytics.” Recent Blogs Subscribe to our blogs",

Generative AI for Merchandising Adobe has integrated generative AI tools into the platform, empowering merchandisers and marketers to create engaging content quickly. This includes product descriptions, category page text, marketing copy, and more. AI enables greater creativity, consistency, and productivity—all while reducing manual effort. 5.

      "content": "Magento to leverage on PWAs for M-commerce Author Category Share Mobile commerce has been influencing e-commerce in a great way, and this trend is only set to grow. It is no longer an auxiliary unit of e-commerce juggernaut. According to report by Invespcro , 1.6 billion people use their mobile phones to shop online. In this article, we will give you a peak into the role of m-commerce and role of Progressive Web Apps in enhancing the mobile shopping experience. In USA, 19% of e-commerce sales are done through the mobile and it is projected to grow to 27% by the end of 2018. If you are still thinking on the lines “Does mobile commerce really effect my business?” let us pull out some amazing stats for you. Mobile sales from tablets rose from $ 38.02 billion in the year 2014 to $81.87 billion in the year 2017. It is projected to hit $ 96.31 billion in the year 2018. Link Mobile sales from Smartphones has risen from $ 18.49 billion in 2014 to $ 30.91 billion in the year 2017. It is projected to hit $ 34.63 billion by year 2018, which is growing around an average of $ 4 billion per year. People who tend to shop via mobile phones tend spend twice as much amount of time than people shopping from desktops. 42% of shoppers will do more shopping on their mobile devices than the previous year. The average order value of iphone user’s stand at $117.76 and android stands at $111.70 for the year 2017. The list only gets more exhaustive and all the figures only tends to support why M-commerce is very important for an e-commerce operation. The M-commerce scenario Though the above stated numbers are enticing, strangely e-commerce merchants are still falling short in m-commerce. According to a report by Business Insider 59% of shoppers spend their time on mobile devices shopping compared to 41% on desktops, but still only 15% of shoppers convert into sales from a mobile device. This trend suggests lack of mobile friendliness for shoppers leading to cart abandonment and less dollar spend from mobile devices. For most e-commerce retailers, driving sales through mobile apps is a real struggle. This statement if augmented by the fact that 94% of the apps downloaded are for social engagement, entertainment and information, which means e-commerce in mobile apps make up for a very small portion. The future of M-commerce – Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) A blend of omni presence of mobile app and the intuitiveness and function of the native apps gave rise to the idea of the Progressive Web apps. In simpler words, Progressive Web Apps combine the best of both the worlds, the web and the native apps. Below are some of the important aspects of PWAs. User interface which is highly interactive and app like that is complete mobile user friendly. Ability to send push notifications similar to native web apps. Improved mobile load time which is a critical factor that would increase customer engagement. Cross platform functionality that is for both iOS and Android. Creation of home screen launch icons, just like the native web app. Optimized content that uses the same URL structure as in the desktop site. This ensures the desktop features and feel is replicated across varied mobile platforms increasing the reach. How is Magento paving the way to power M-commerce? Magento has an overall e-commerce market share of 7.34% and powers 159,234 sites worldwide. The medium Magento has opted for re-imagining mobile shopping experience is through development of PWA apps for Magento merchants. To strengthen their expertise, Magento has collaborated with Google to leverage their technical expertise. The sole aim is to bring the whole PWA capabilities to the full Magento e-commerce community by year 2018. In the words of Mark Lavelle, CEO Magento “We see PWAs as a natural evolution of the mobile web, and by working with industry leaders such as Google to develop PWAs, we plan to keep merchants ahead of the curve.” With the pace at which M-commerce is developing, it is imperative for the top e-commerce platforms to focus on this frontier. The good thing is Magento joining the m-commerce bandwagon along with Google is only going to make things interesting. Conclusion Ecommerce as an industry is moving towards M-commerce. While there are many strategies to leverage on M-commerce, Magento seems to be going the PWA way along with Google and this might just be the next big thing for ecommerce industry.

Medical Equipment industry is not remain immune to magic of eCommerce and rightly so. United States of America is the largest target market for sales of Medical equipment and allied Medical devices globally.

Johnson and Johnson a behemoth which deals in Medical equipment and devices globally registered $ 35 billion through sales in US alone. The list goes on and on.

With these strong winds of change, are you ready to streamline the challenges that make selling medical equipment online easy? Challenges faced by the Medical equipment industry Securing Data Medical and health industry is a domain where there is sensitive information not only related to financial details but even customer personal information involved. With the amount of security breaches happening online safeguarding such sensitive information is very important. Any misuse of this data would have serious repercussions to the company financially. Managing Patient Experience The customers whom you target are your average retail customers. They are quite special and you should make every interaction with your customers count. You as a business should have an apparatus in place where things like shipping of complex medical equipment like power wheel chairs, taking insurance cover and other benefits into account and having the patient’s medical condition and history in one place should be taken care of. Many retailers who are selling medical equipment online have this figured out. If you do not take this into measure simply going online does not make sense. Medical equipment industry even should address the challenge of customer personalization. There should be a mechanism where the patients or customers must be dealt with in an individual way based on their previous medical history and prior requirements. This way providing a great customer experience becomes easier for businesses planning to sell online. Detailed product description Shoppers and customers are very much into eCommerce and they expect the same kind of experience for any product they shop. It includes buying medical equipment like lift chairs, power wheelchairs and even medical drugs. Having detailed pictures with 360° view and with detailed product descriptions of the make, weight it supports or any related information goes a long way. Having extensions on your site to show relevant alternative products even makes the users search easier and gives you an opportunity to cross or upsell products. i95Dev experience and implementations in medical equipment industry We have been providing industry specific eCommerce solutions to companies from various industries since 2000.

      "content": "Automobile Aftermarket Challenges Unravelled – An eCommerce Perspective Automobile Aftermarket Challenges Unravelled – An eCommerce Perspective Author Category Share According to a report by Grand View Research, Inc ., automobile aftermarket industry is evolving fast and is expected to reach more than $486 billion by 2025. It is found that the trend of customer intention to buy auto parts online, doubled, in a span of 3 years. In addition, according to Pixel Produtions, Inc ., there are 70 million auto parts (aftermarket) searches every month on Google. While it is a lucrative proposition, after-sales market is tricky for many reasons. While everyone uses cars, most of them do not repair their own car. Although there is a slight growth in DIY enthusiasts, these numbers still amount to only a fraction. Most of the aftermarket parts are purchased by servicing stations in most markets around the world. Hence, the aftermarket sales are largely a B2B market. In this blog, we try to look at some key challenges of automobile aftermarket ecommerce and role of a partner in its success. Key Challenges in Automobile Aftermarket Ecommerce Inventory woes – There are numerous players in the industry across the world who produced various models, with a few of these models in production for more than a decade. To serve such an industry, the aftermarket industry handles a large variety of parts in different sizes. This can be an inventory management nightmare. Automobile aftermarket ecommerce players need serious solutions that handle these challenges. Shipping is critical – Atleast for larger auto parts, shipping is tedious and challenging. Not all shipping operators are suitable for such needs. When dealing with larger auto parts, this information should be tracked real time and made available to the end customers. To achieve this, ecommerce players needs an integrated eco-system to bring together disparate systems. Without such a facility, customer experience is bound to take a hit. Upselling to customers – Upsell and cross-sell generates a lot of revenue. However, not all ecommerce players have the necessary setup to achieve this. Most offline store generate good amount of revenue from this by recommending parts that fetch them better margins. Replicating this means having a good ecommerce setup in place to manage the information in real time. Handling custom orders – Most B2B ecommerce business must offer certain amount of customization and automobile after parts market is no exception. The workflow needed to handle the custom requests is quite different from a standard request and is unique to each business. Solutions for Popular Challenges Platforms like Magento ( Read our blog on why Magento 2 is good for B2B ) have evolved to deliver most B2B feature that lacked in their predecessors. However, companies generally have critical and specific needs. Finding all those features in a single platform is rarity and a partner like i95Dev fits perfectly in such a scenario. We helped numerous companies build custom solution to suit their specific business needs and enhance customer experience . Let us look at how a growth partner like us can help and build custom solutions for the above discussed challenges. While Magento can work with many inventory management platforms, not all custom workflows are supported. A typical automobile aftermarket parts store has large set of SKUs which is bound to grow perpetually. One solution for this is to provide a blow up diagram that can help navigate the product SKUs. To have this feature on your ecommerce store, you will need to pull the details of the parts the customer is looking at on real time basis and populate the same. A tight ERP ecommerce integration is a must for this scenario. If inventory management is your key problem, read our blog. Custom shipping information needs – Larger inventory are inevitable and must be handled by specialized shipping companies. This information generally resides on ERP. By making this information available to the end user, the customer will stay informed on the status of the delivery. This also allows you to send automated messages when the delivery is going to be early or late. Upselling and cross selling can help enhance revenues. However, these features need real-time information from ERP on inventory status, available price discounts, compatibility with the product in the cart, etc. These details can be easily populated with a connector like i95Dev’s Dynamics line of products. With minimal customizations, specific requirements (like populating products available in the same warehouse as the product in the cart) can also be met. Custom requirements are common in any B2B scenario and automobile industry is no exception. Such scenarios need effective information management right from capturing the requirement to shipping the same. With a major amount of the operational data flowing from ERP, Magento ERP integration is vital in such a case. All the above scenarios are based on our experience helping various ecommerce player over the period of more than 17 years. We help ecommerce players across the world build connected ecommerce eco-system. Our expertise spans over multiple ERPs including MS Dynamics GP, NAV, AX, 365, SAGE 100 and SAP B1. We work with leading solution provides in the ecommerce ecosystem to add value to our customers. For more information on how we can help you, please contact us on info@i95dev.com .

      "content": "i95Dev Magento B2B Extensions – A Quick Overview Author Category Share Companies operating in the B2B space are quickly adopting eCommerce. The past few years saw the emergence of major players in B2B eCommerce segment. However, according to MarketingLand , only 11% of the B2B is on ecommerce in 2016. This indicates a clear growth path for B2B ecommerce and the ecommerce players are about to witness a substantial and sustainable growth. A new or a growing B2B ecommerce players needs to gear up for the growth to leverage on this opportunity. This blog talks about the challenges of B2B companies in emulating the offline experience online and how ERP ecommerce integration, along with a few other connectors, can help. Connected ecosystem bridges the gap to allow seamless flow of information. However, mere interconnection of multiple systems will not be sufficient. Each eCommerce player has specific requirements and need custom solutions. Below are some such modules and their role in the B2B eCommerce business, which enhance the functionality of the eco-system. 1. Simplifying Quotation Process B2B organizations operate in complex environments, deals with large number of suppliers and distributors. They mostly follow a typical flow – request for proposal, go in for negotiation, quotations are made accordingly and send to the requester, closes with the requester accepting the proposal. Once the deal is closed, the transaction occurs. Magento 2 offers some of these features. However, most players need better flexibility to address their needs. i95Dev Magento B2B extension Advanced Quote Module expands the stock features by adding full quotation process and giving your business the necessary edge to accomplish business objectives. 2 . Quick Ordering B2B customer is more often a returning customer who knows exactly what he needs. All they look for is the ease in searching products, and importantly selecting bulk products at one go when they buy those items regularly. Even Magento 2 falls short in this feature to support necessary flexibility. Lack of this feature (and ability to customize) forces bulk buyers to search or browse products one by one, which affects the customer experience. i95Dev Magento B2B extension ‘Quick Order Module’ helps your business facilitate customers to purchase products just with complete or part SKU numbers and designate quantity for purchase. This makes the journey of repeat buyers easy, as they no longer have to perform the repetitive time taking a task to order in bulk online. 3. Simplifying the work of a B2B salesperson One key challenge a B2B salesperson faces is his information management of his leads and clients. If the information is not available readily to him, he ends up spending time sifting through information and his productivity takes a hit. Our Magento B2B extension ‘ SalesPerson module’ allows assigning a specific salesperson to each customer or group of customers to provide the best customer service. Sales reps can easily access transaction history, order status, custom pricing levels and billing and shipping information, as well as place orders for customers. This is possible due to the communication between Magento and the ERP. Some of the benefits are: The creation of a new salesperson in Magento will update the ERP with the new information in real time. The Magento store admin can assign commissions, customers, and orders to a specific salesperson The salesperson can log in to manage their information, including customers and orders. Reporting of commissions and total orders is available in real-time for everyone 4. Net Terms Terms of payment play an important aspect in closing the account. B2B store often fail in providing the details of net terms and this lack of information is a key challenge. A B2B eCommerce store must make sure that the information is available on the store payment window. This Magento B2B extension ‘Net Terms Module’ helps your customers choose a suitable payment terms and pay their pending invoices from the convenience of the Magento e-commerce store. This information is synced back to ERP to make sure your account books are up-to-date. 5. National Accounts A B2B company tends to a variety of companies that have different credit limits and terms. When B2B eCommerce companies leverage on the ERP Magento integration, the online transactions must be in sync with the ERP structure. Our ’National Accounts module’ allows B2B eCommerce players maintain the accounts books intact, while they scale their B2B e-commerce business. It automates various aspects like maintaining parent account details updated in ERP and eCommerce, maintains children information, maintains the pre-defined parent-child hierarchy, generates the parent entity for child entity’s expenditure, etc. 6. Bill Pay & Credit Limit Process of payment in B2B is generally complicated compared to a B2C scenario. Aspects like partial payment and single invoicing for parent accounts are important in B2B scenario. The payment options offered are specific to each eCommerce company. However, Magento might be able to address all the specific challenges. i95Dev’s ’Bill Pay module’ can help B2B eCommerce players bring the much needed flexibility into payment process. Coupled with one of our suite of connectors, this module can take care of all the bill pay needs and credit limits of customers.

      "content": "Enabling Cross Border E-commerce -with Zonos - i95Dev Enabling Cross Border eCommerce -with Zonos Author Category Share Wouldn’t you agree that you aren’t leveraging on international customers? A study predicts that Cross border shopping will make up 20 percent of e-commerce in 2022. With the rapid increase in new e-commerce players, it is now essential to gain a competitive edge. However, the question remains as to how? Though you might want to explore the possibilities of acquiring international customers, there stand challenges. How fair is it for your E-commerce company to lose out on potential international customers? Challenges of Cross Border E-commerce The idea of expanding to more than a single territory is a possibility considered by many e-commerce companies. However, the hurdles both internal and external, leave the possibility short-lived for e-commerce companies. Let us take a look at the cross border selling issues. Language Barrier The most common challenge that cross border selling faces is the language barrier. It is crucial to design the website as per the language needs if you are planning to sell across the borders. According to a survey, about 52% of online shoppers prefer buying on sites with their language. Also, 85.3% have agreed that having pre-purchase information in their language is a critical factor in making important buying decisions. Most of the e-commerce websites offer a uniform version of shopping online in English to attract international customers. Issues related to regulation The next hurdle e-commerce companies face – regulation. There is inconsistency on the regulations. Each country has its own set of regulations for trading. Consider this; if you don’t meet the required regulations of the product you ship, you might face legal trouble. Furthermore, even developed countries like the US are uncertain about the applicability of state taxes on e-commerce transactions. Higher product price and shipping cost The next dominant share of the challenge is that of a higher price product and shipping cost. Most of the e-commerce companies are clueless as to the terms of pricing. Customers end up paying a higher price and shipping cost. While companies have minimal knowledge of pricing, they also lack insights on how to sell internationally online. Many a time, customers find the same product at a lower price in their country. Logistics You need to develop a strong logistics process for your company. Effective logistics has been considered to help companies gain a competitive advantage both online and offline. The expenses related to your cross-border logistics can be the tipping point for your e-commerce business. However, it is not just about the costs. It is also about predictability and reliability. E-commerce companies who think their role ends once the product reaches the logistics provider must change. Customers now hold you responsible for ensuring that their order reaches them. Not having organized logistics will increase the complexity in the case of return logistics. Considering the costs incurred, documentation, customs duties and so on, many of the e-commerce companies are not in a situation to provide return option to the cross border customers. Payment Methods and Processing Research states that there is 69.2% shopping cart abandonment in the year 2017 . People tend to abandon their carts the moment they find the price in a different currency or don’t find the payment option they are looking for. Payment preferences are varied across the world. If you stand uninformed about the payment system in a country, you will be at a loss. For instance, nearly 100% of e-commerce transactions in Spain are by MasterCard, Visa, and American Express. It is about 60% in France and 30% in Germany. In Japan, people use a local payment method that shares about one-sixth of the e-commerce transactions. It is interesting to observe that Asian countries have shown an inclination towards cash on delivery. Accepting the payment method your customer needs is an advantage. Building Trust If you are an e-commerce player who has crossed the hurdles as mentioned above, the next challenge lies in gaining the trust of your customer. People have their doubts when they buy online on the quality of the product, the payment means and the shipment of the product. Maintaining transparency about the processes and returns and quick response time will help the customer gain trust. Choosing the right markets Lastly, a question to consider even before the expansion is the profits you’d be making in a given time frame. Investing in new marketing without carrying out proper research can affect your decisions adversely. Often companies overlook the most obvious choices to the ones where true potential lie. In order to choose the right market, companies must profile the countries and determine their potential. The search frequencies analysis can help companies understand the products people are more aligned within a region. How to overcome Cross Border E-commerce challenges with Zonos We now know the possible difficulties in Cross Border E-commerce. Let us now try understanding how we can overcome these challenges. Your aim as an e-commerce company is to unravel the complexities without losing hold on your business. Read on to know how you can achieve that. Make payments comfortable The major success lies in optimizing the customer experience by providing your international customers the experience they prefer. As we have seen above, payment plays a significant role in international orders. Zonos Payments helps support about 132 different currencies. The payments are captured in local currency and also offers local payments. Your customers no longer have to feel overwhelmed concerning the currency. Multiple Shipping Options One of the most critical factors for customer satisfaction and conversion is providing multiple shipping options at checkout. Most of the e-commerce players lose out on customers on the checkout page as the shipping options are either expensive or limited or don’t match the needs. Customers have no choice but to leave your e-store. How about matching to the expectations of your customers? Customize the options you offer to your customers on checkout. Provide your customers’ price variants and service levels from which they can choose. Localize to Globalize A report states that 75% of shoppers prefer to buy products in their native language. Though international shoppers can use translation tools, the tools don’t work once they reach the secured checkout page. This again leaves them with indecisiveness and sudden surprise leading to cart abandonment. It is your responsibility to handle this issue for your customers. Provide them a translated checkout for boosting the purchase intent. Zonos localization helps you translate 18 languages for your international customers. Zonos also localizes the address field specific to a country. It dynamically shows only those fields relevant to a country. Zonos Localization API and Zonos Checkout support localizing the address fields to your customer by hiding fields like a postal code field where they do not use postal codes. Also, it will supply correct terminology for that label. Global Compliance Compliance is another barrier to cross border sellers. The protection of consumer data has become essential considering the global retail e-commerce expansion. More than 100 countries around the globe have data protection laws. Zonos can help you manage the cross-border compliance like international taxation, privacy consent and so on. Conclusion Expanding e-commerce across the borders has become the need of the hour. While we see the cross border selling issues, we have also found a solution to negate these challenges. i95Dev provides a comprehensive set of solutions for improving your Magento e-commerce website. We see Zonos as a complementary product for a more enhanced e-commerce experience. So, are you all set for cross border e-commerce?

      "content": "Magento Vs Demandware – Key Differences Author Category Share A perfectly scalable e-commerce platform lies at the heart of any e-commerce business or operation. In the past, shopping was everything related to a brick and mortar store or a fancy retail outlet, which covered the local neighborhood. However, today’s picture is far from it. In the current era of the internet-fueled e-commerce boom, a web store becomes the storefront, which hosts its products and services. Hence, a website can be the differentiator between an iconic brand and one that gradually fades into the oblivion. However, with the number of options available in the market, today choosing the correct e-commerce platform is no mean fete. To start with, many factors come to play. While choosing an e-commerce platform, below are a few factors to consider. Is the e-commerce platform hosted or self-hosted Ability to provide robust support and back up network Ability to integrate with various back end systems Pricing and maintenance cost Upon considering these points, no seasoned analyst with a penchant for eCommerce can fail to compare the two most robust and scalable e-commerce platforms operating in the domain, Magento and Demandware. Magento vs Demandware In this article, we will dwell deeper into the features of two top of the line eCommerce platforms, which are both contemporaries and leaders, related to certain features. Some of the largest e-commerce stores are powered by the platforms Demandware and Magento. This article outlines the features of both the platform through the prism of the broad categories which is important while identifying an eCommerce platform. Hosting and Maintenance Demandware: This e-commerce platform offers a fully hosted multi-tenant proprietary solution, which means all the infrastructure is managed by Demandware. This is an attractive option for e-commerce companies, who do not want to get into the hassles of security and maintenance of the site and solely concentrate on selling their products and services. But the real problem arises when a business wants to install a customized add on module for their eStore. These exclusive customizations require approval from Demandware and their restrictions are said to be in place to ensure the site still functions after the customization. However, this makes rolling out of quick and customized solutions to scale up e-commerce operations near to impossible with Demandware. Magento: E-commerce businesses must have come across enough criticism related to Magento of being too technical and complicated to manage. However, Magento on the other side, it is a self-hosted solution and gives complete control to the store owner over the infrastructure. There are many expert Magento agencies which maintain strong relations with hosting partners and act as intermediaries to handle any upgrade and infrastructural changes. There is even scope for adding customized modules to scale up a business without the need to take any approvals, in short Magento lets the e-commerce business own their store infrastructure. Hosting is a topic in itself. Here is a blog from our very own Ankit Agarwal on what goes into infrastructure planning . Have you tried Nexcess ? Scope for Integration Demandware: All the features required for flawless functioning of an e-commerce store is taken care in the platform Demandware. It unifies order management, POS and other offline store operations into one solution. There are even built-in tools that enable in-store representatives to engage with customers on the shop floor using mobile devices, which eases assisting customers by offering personalized product suggestions. Magento: This platform is an open-source platform that increases the elbow space for businesses to maneuver around and scale their operations with customized integration modules. It is a clear advantage over Demandware. There is an ever-increasing community of Magento evangelists, developers and agencies available worldwide that helps in upkeep and maintenance of Magento platform. This is the appeal and clear advantage that Magento holds up its sleeve because of the existing integration available for third-party service of choice with a huge array of modules pre-built and available through the Magento marketplace. Read our ebook on ERP Magento integration touchpoints to get a feel of the flexibility offered by Magento. Support and flexibility Demandware: There is a robust support system in place for Demandware platform with a 24/7 support available which is not confined to only support for core issues. Apart from the support system in place, the other issues that the Demandware platform addresses for its users are: Flexibility around the SEO Giving users control over redirects Powerful cross-selling and up-selling options Customer-facing email management Built-in PLP merchandising The support and flexibility offered by Demandware look great for any eCommerce business. However, it comes with a heavy price tag, which is a huge drawback for small and medium-sized eCommerce operations looking for a scalable eCommerce platform option. Magento: The platform of Magento is renowned for the eco-system of support services it has in place and the level of support it provides even deals with serious code issues which are very important for the smooth running of eCommerce operations. Apart from that, Magento even offers services such as: Purchase mails email management Options for the customer service representatives to input orders through backend which is a huge advantage to reducing the scope for manual errors if bi-directional sync between Magento and ERP is made Excellent built-in visual merchandising after Magento acquired Ontap Visual merchandizer extension Customized coupons The clear advantage Magento has over Demandware is the number of features available to e-commerce players without being too costly and taking a toll on their economies. Customizations Magento: Customization includes overall store interface including themes as well as the backend. Magento opens up the code to make any necessary changes to it. With the presence of a large agency network and a thriving community, it is very easy to make these visual changes. Demandware: While Demandware also provides flexibility to customize the platform, it is nowhere near to that of Magento. Demandware team must approve any changes made on the platform. The community and the agencies for Demandware are limited and hence, the resources are rarely making them costly. Community Magento: Magento enjoys the benefits of having a large community. The community edition of Magento has given eCommerce players the flexibility to make any necessary changes. Today, this community grew to more than a hundred thousand community members. The sheer amount of value you can derive from this community is overwhelming. Demandware: Demandware, on the other hand, has a limited number of registered agencies who can help you make changes to the platform. The resources with Demandware expertise are expensive ones and it is hard to find quality consultants, who can help you improve your platform. While you have most features needed for your business, aspects like developing specific feature because it is important for your business, is going to be difficult. B2B eCommerce Magento: Magento has picked up a lot of market learning from Magento 1 and brought it to Magento 2. Today, Magento 2 is a platform with rich B2B features. Most customers can readily access the B2B business features in Magento like Multiple buyers per account Request a quote Quick order entry and requisition list Payment to accounts Company credits & more Customers had to depend on third-party extensions in the past to enable these features. Demandware: While Demandware fares decently in B2C features, most features required for B2B are missing in Demandware. This is a critical shortfall in Demandware. This is the reason most B2B eCommerce companies do not opt for Demandware. While this gap can be filled using extensions, it makes the development process complicated. Agencies and Developers Demandware: There are not many agencies, who can work on Demandware, and even the number of developers who can work on Demandware software is particularly less. The number of websites on the Demandware platform is 49,994 and the agencies which work on Demandware charge exorbitant prices. Magento: This is the segment where Magento beats Demandware hollow. The number of websites that run on Magento platform hovers at the number 356,123 and boasts a strong agency and developer community. Magento is available in both the free and the paid enterprise version even the experienced agencies that work on Magento quote prices which are far economical compared to its pricier counterpart. Pricing Demandware: Given the number of features being offered by eCommerce platforms pricing would definitely be perceived as a deal clincher for small and mid-size enterprises. Demandware charges eCommerce businesses a license fee and a commission from the sale made via the platform. As the eCommerce business grows, they need to shell out more for the Demandware platform. The annual subscription of Demandware would make the e-commerce business poorer by 700,000 USD and the implementation would cost 400,000 USD. Magento: Magento is not the market leader in e-commerce platforms without a reason and the primary reason being the price where even the paid version of Magento i.e the Enterprise Edition costs way lesser than Demandware. The annual licensing fee of Magento would cost 18,000 USD per server and the implementation would cost 375,000 USD. Even if the annual recurring costs are calculated Magento still makes a more economical and scalable bet for small and mid-size e-commerce businesses. Here is our blog on Magento Community Vs Enterprise comparison including the prices of these editions.

Further, with time businesses understood the need for integrating their e-commerce platform with their internal ERP. However, the integration of Magento and Dynamics GP itself has challenges that you may face. We bring you an article that will not just explain the challenges of Magento and Microsoft Dynamics GP integration; it will also help you in solving them! It will give you a better understanding of the integration and describers why the integration of Magento and Dynamics GP is considered one of the best options. What do we understand by Magento and Dynamics GP integration? The founder of Conversion XL, Peep Laja, said, ’Remember, every mistake a user makes is not because they are stupid; but because your website sucks! ’ If you can ignore the somewhat-offensive tone of the quote you will realize that this is what is expected of every e-commerce website. Customers are king and they do not stick around for long, while business keeps making things right! When eCommerce businesses realize that almost all the problems could be solved by the integration of their e-commerce platform with ERP, they went for it. To put in simpler terms, businesses need e-commerce and ERP integration when: They keep overselling They are shipping orders wrong or late They waste their employees’ and the business’ time on manual entry of data Their offline and online experiences are not consistent They do not have visibility into the data of their suppliers Their product information is messy and inaccurate They start investing more time and effort in customer service to fix their errors Magento and Microsoft Dynamics GP integration: The Challenges Not being able to understand the ”real” requirements! Everybody wants to make his or her business automated. However, you must understand – when you automate a bad process, you are making the bad process run faster! Conceptually, the integration of Magento and Dynamics GP is easy to understand and the basic idea is the same too. However, you must invest time and put a good effort to analyze the process, understand how it will work and that you will be able to know when you have a clear understanding of the requirements. You must identify the usage of the software and the pain points related to it. An ideal way to get started is to map out all the critical processes before the migration. You can talk to experts (like us) as they will help you understand the requirements, and how exactly the integration of Magento and Dynamics GP will take your business to a new height. Engaging the RIGHT people in the integration process Whenever a business chooses the integration of their eShop and ERP, they tend to involve mostly just the IT department. It is a common perception that the integration is a work for the IT staff and they will know better; this is where the first challenge occurs – not understanding the requirement properly. To get a clear picture of what you want out of the integration of Magento and Dynamics GP, you will have to involve all the key people across your entire company from warehouse, manufacturing, operations to the finance department. When you involve the entire organization in the process, you will know the problems that they are facing and in the process, you will be able to assess what exactly you want from the integration of Magento and Dynamics GP. How much should you spend? While we all know it that automating the entire business process by integrating Magento and Dynamics GP is much cost-effective, you must have a clear understanding of how much you should spend. Neither you should overspend nor should you compromise on the necessary expenses. Primarily you should consider the expense, which is associated with the implementation and maintenance and then take into account the expense related to the level of talent or required workforce to get your project successfully off the ground. Therefore, take your time to budget properly and take into consideration the required talent along with the implementation, execution, and maintenance. Identifying industry-specific features While it is a good feeling to have a system that will take care of every operation, you still need to have a clear understanding of the features that are particularly beneficial to your business and to the industry you are in. To put it in simpler terms: the features that can be more beneficial for an FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) company may not be very useful for a clothing brand! Therefore, it is always a good idea to know what the features are and which of these will be beneficial for your business. Easy to get confused with the bedazzling features! You must be thinking – Is it not a good thing? It is; however, when we find a product that has too many features, we tend to get overwhelmed and assume that it has everything! Imagine, a smartphone that said you can do almost everything a phone and a high-end camera can do, and after you purchase it, you find that you cannot forward an SMS from that phone! Remember that you chose the integration of Magento and Dynamics GP to make your business better and therefore, you should know how it is going to help. If you face any difficulties, you can always contact the customer service of the service provider and ask them. Should you implement the entire system at once? This is a tough one – determining how to implement the system. ERP systems are generally complex and determining every implementation requirement is tough. The ideal way to go forward is to choose an agile approach and the implementation should be done in small steps. Further, as mentioned before you should involve the right people at all steps to understand the requirements, determine the gaps, test the system, and then go ahead. Change management Although the integration of Magento and Dynamics GP will make things a lot better, the change management should be considered seriously. The systems and analysis need deep analysis along with the people factor that requires careful consideration as well and then you should go with the strategic planning. An organization can assume that with the integration of Magento and Dynamics GP will bring in much configurable and manageable business operations, but the migration from one system to another will require a lot of thinking, identifying, and then implementation. The integration is not as quick as many assume it to be as there are important things that need to be lined up before the entire system is changed for a better approach. Neglecting change management can lead an organization to struggle to adopt the new process. Having a maintenance plan in place Implementing the integration of Magento and Dynamics GP will take time; however, the work will not stop once the integration is in place successfully and the system is up and running. Your business should keep a maintenance strategy in line, which will make sure your employees are aligned and they have a clear idea and understanding of what should be done to improve and maintain the new system regularly so it does not become obsolete and outdated. An outdated system will put your company at risk; there could be security issues as well as gaps in the many business processes. However, with a well-planned maintenance plan, you will have a clear understanding of processes and the right people responsible for every role. Further, with a good maintenance plan, your system will run smoothly and will be up-to-date with every latest application. These are the most common challenges that a company faces before, while or after integrating Magento and Dynamics GP. These challenges can hamper business in the end if not addressed at the right time. Takeaway points! Businesses trust the integration of Magento and Microsoft Dynamics GP because it ensures that the business runs smoothly and effectively, and EVERYBODY IS USING IT! The fact that almost everybody (even the competitors) are going for the integration makes it mandatory for almost every business. The disadvantage of choosing an integration without understanding how it works can lead to many problems. While the features and benefits of the integration of Magento and Dynamics GP are bedazzling, most businesses face the above challenges while and before implementing the integration of Magento and Dynamics GP.

      "content": "Magento Vs WooCommerce - Choose Right eCommerce Platform | i95Dev Magento vs WooCommerce – Which eCommerce Platform Takes the Gold? Author Category Share If you are looking for an eCommerce platform to build your web store on, you have landed spot on! It is no more unusual these days, when your smartphones are bombarded with ads from companies offering e-commerce platforms. Most of them are lying through their teeth by flashing cheap offering baits. Their true colours begin to surface shortly after your online store goes live. Amongst the common challenges would be your website running slow and at times being inaccessible, the code being outdated, navigation issues, difficult to extend, and so on and so forth. However, if you put your bet on either Magento or WooCommerce, it is unlikely they will fail you! The question still remains unanswered as to which eCommerce platform is the most appropriate for your business. Of course, you can’t build your e-store on both, right? To help you choose the better between the two, we have done a comparative study of their strengths and shortcomings: Feature Magento WooCommerce Winner Ease of use It is not a child’s play to be able to install Magento as the installer language may leave rookies a bit confused about certain significant settings. Once the setup is done, one has to invest sometime in learning the basics. What can be a trouble for the developers is customizing themes or installing extensions. One has to seek external help. In comparison to Magento, WooCommerce can be effortlessly installed by the beginners. In fact, a non-technical person can also get the job done in a breeze. WooCommerce comes with a setup wizard that guides you step-by-step, thereby, making the installation process easier. WooCommerce Payment options By default, Magento comes with cash on delivery, PayPal, bank transfer, Authorize.net, and purchase order payment methods. In addition, its APIs comprise options for the developers to integrate payment gateways. What’s more, Magento flaunts extensions for payment gateways such as Google Checkout, WePay, Braintree, and more. WooCommerce offers PayPal and Stripe payments by default. It also supports all major payment gateways through extensions and addons. WooCommerce even supports many regional and lesser-known payment companies. Since it is so easy to extend, any payment company can create an add-on for WooCommerce and provide support for it. Tie Security Magento wins the race in this aspect. It offers dedicated security patches to its users. It enables advanced security measures manually and through extensions. As far as advanced security measures are concerned, WooCommerce stands at par with Magento. However, it does not offer dedicated security patches for its users. Magento Support Magento has an edge over WooCommerce when it comes to 24/7 support. Additionally, there is a big Magento Community, ever-ready to offer help. Not to mention, the paid Magento Edition offers superior, dedicated support. On the other hand, WooCommerce lags behind in terms of support. It was introduced in the market four years after Magento, thus, it lacks that head start. Unlike Magento, WooCommerce does not have a massive community of developers who provide instant support. Magento Plugins and Extensions Magento in-built plugins and extensions come with various features. You can make use of them for customizing new functionalities and speeding up your business. However, you need Magento developers for seamlessly installing the extensions and plugins. By the same token, WooCommerce allows you to install various plugins to customize your website according to your business requirements. When compared to Magento 2, it is way cheaper to install simple plugins for your WooCommerce store. However, the Magento extensions are way more powerful than WooCommerce ones. Another drawback is that you have to buy WooCommerce plugins as they are not in-built, unlike Magento. Magento Cost Magento is a self-hosted open source software and is available in two editions – community edition and enterprise edition. Magento Commerce, the small business plan, comes with a monthly subscription coupled with a revenue-based license cost. Magento’s paid plans are are pretty costly. In addition, the cost increases if you hire a developer to work on your Magento store and install paid extensions and themes. WooCommerce is a free software that can be downloaded and installed by anyone. To start a WooCommerce store, you just have to register a domain name, WordPress hosting account, and an SSL certificate. This is cheaper than the Magento community edition. WooCommerce Scaling your business Scaling your business with Magento includes additional cost and technical challenges. If you are making use of the community edition, you have to do it all by yourself. What’s more, you have to optimize your store for caching, use a firewall to protect against denial-of-service attacks, manage backups, and more. The misery multiplies, if you are inexperienced in managing big websites. In such a case, hiring Magento specialists is the only option you are left with. It is better to go for Magento’s paid enterprise plans if you are ready to bear all the cost. Similar technical challenges are faced by WooCommerce too, however, you have multiple options to keep the growth going while controlling costs. First of all, you can move to managed WordPress hosting providers that allow easy scaling of your online store. Secondly, for improving performance, you have various easy caching options that keep your server resources low and allows business to grow. In addition, WordPress specialists are cheaper than those of Magento. Therefore, your e-store can perform at much lower costs even at the enterprise level. WooCommerce Conclusion Announcing a winner between WooCommerce and Magento is not an easy pick. To put it bluntly, speaking, each of them comes with its own pros and cons. While Magento flaunts powerful extensions, WooCommerce steals the show in its ease of usage. Magento is the perfect e-commerce platform for you if you want to scale up and expand your business on a global level. On the other hand, if you are a start-up or a small business, WooCommerce is your pick as it is easy to use. It is extremely important to analyse the nature of your business and your requirements before making a choice. Get in touch with i95Dev for eliminating your confusion.

From operating multiple stores catering to different regions, to running eCommerce stores servicing B2B and B2C customers, the complexities are many. For example, Managing product catalogue while also ensuring consistency across channels. Managing customer information spread across various systems to ensure seamless experience across channels. Streamlining inventory management while ensuring faster order processing. And more. The solution to these commonly faced challenges lies in automating data sync between your eCommerce and ERP systems, such as Adobe Commerce and Oracle NetSuite ERP. By bringing these two powerful platforms together, you can streamline your operations, improve efficiency, and ultimately enhance your customer satisfaction. Let us explore the common challenges of eCommerce businesses that warrant an automated data sync between Adobe Commerce and NetSuite ERP systems. Common Challenges Mid-Sized and Large Businesses eCommerce Businesses Running a successful eCommerce business involves efficient inventory management, streamlined order processing, and centralized customer data across various channels and regions. Many businesses encounter significant pain points, such as: Data Fragmentation Across Multiple Stores: Operating multiple Adobe Commerce stores often results in inconsistencies in data across regions and product catalogs. When each store operates independently, it leads to challenges in tracking performance and inventory, making it difficult to derive actionable insights. Complex Inventory Requirements: Businesses with diverse product offerings and multiple warehouses face a constant battle to maintain accurate inventory levels. Without real-time visibility into stock across all locations, businesses risk either overstocking or stockouts, which can severely impact sales and customer satisfaction. Inefficient Order Management: The flexibility of Adobe Commerce allows for the creation of custom order workflows tailored to unique business needs. However, managing these workflows can become cumbersome without the right automation in place, leading to delays and inefficiencies in order fulfillment. Data Silos and High Manual Entry: Many businesses still rely on manual data entry to manage their operations, which increases the risk of errors and inefficiencies. Data silos created by disconnected systems lead to a lack of visibility, making it challenging to provide a seamless customer experience.

      "content": "B2B Marketing Strategies Implemented For B2C E-Commerce B2B Marketing Strategies Implemented For B2C eCommerce Author Category Share Well, there is no denying the thing that B2B and B2C marketing campaigns are two different sides of the marketing world. But in today’s digital realm, B2B marketing is diverse, transparent, and also works best for B2C e-commerce. It now works on a different level, and both the marketing strategies have started to merge. With this happening, read here how cosmetic industry marketers can implement the B2B marketing strategies for B2C e-commerce ( read how to grow and excel B2B e-commerce ). B2B (Business to Business) Marketing B2B marketing includes the strategies that allow one business to sell their products and services directly to other businesses. Not just to the business, but the managers or the decision makers of a specific business. It includes marketing of everything from automobile parts to table management software’s, marketing services, offices furniture, and lot more. B2C (Business to Customer) Marketing The B2C marketing strategies work on selling the products to the customers for their personal usage. It also refers to all the tactics that are used to promote the goods and services among the consumers. Difference between B2B and B2C Marketing Strategies B2B and B2C marketing strategies aim to garner the attention of two distinct set of audiences. Whether a business is trying to sell a product or driving leads and prospects, both the channels work on different approaches in regard to content, industry jargon, life cycles, buying cycle span, and lot more. The B2B marketing includes a number of businesses and is based on need and logic, while B2C marketing works just for customers. B2C also invokes the emotional responses, but the B2B works solely on demonstrating the value. There are times when they share the same technical practices like re-targeting abandoned carts, negative keywords, and more, but here are the crucial differences that separate the two. Industry Jargon: The B2B marketers use professional and industry-specific words on their platforms. But when it comes to B2C, the language should be easy and must be related to the customers. Drivers: The B2C consumers are often motivated by the desires and internal forces including wants and needs, while the B2B businesses are driven by rational factors like price, deals, and business relationships. Length of Content: The lengthy content works for B2B marketing, but the B2C customers look for short content or something that can entice them. Buying Cycle: B2C has an immediate buying cycle. On the flip side, B2B has quite a long cycle as it is meant to complete long-term business goals. Moreover, in B2B, the marketers also have to deal with accounting and a series of superiors to get their purchases approved. Brand Relationship: A B2C consumer is not always looking to build a relationship with the brand. While the B2B customers look to build a close relationship with other businesses and brands. With these differences, we can say that both the marketing concepts work in two spectrums. However, in today’s online realm, the eCommerce landscape is based on many channels and the B2C marketers have started to leverage B2B marketing strategies. It works out as a crossover that leads to an increase in the scope of marketing opportunities, leads, clients, and revenues. According to the 2017 research published at Shopify, the B2B Marketing Capabilities lead to 62% enhanced research, 51% specials and promotions, 56% reviews and 54% personalized recommendations. Can We Combine B2C And B2B Strategies? Yes. Usually, the B2C customers assume that their campaigns only need to focus on selling the products, and hence, they end up leaving the long-term engagement for the B2B marketing strategies. So, to build a relationship as well as revenue, here is how a B2C marketer can use B2B marketing strategies. Conduct a Research on Your Leads and Eligible Partners To make the most of your marketing campaigns, it is important to have a better knowledge of your clients and prospects. The research will bring a lot of potential to the surface and allows you to deliver better customer experience. Moreover, you will also find the factors that will influence your success and services that might benefit your business. When it comes to the partners, you can research the well-known ventures and collaborate with them. They can utilize your products for their studies, confirm its value, and add the details that are found in their research. Once your product is equipped with the best third-party reviews and details, it is more likely to get purchases from the ‘skeptical set of customers’. Encourage Customers Feedback and Ratings Collecting feedback from customers is an important part of the B2B marketing strategy. The ‘feedback approach’ helps you to understand your audience and improve your services. Moreover, there is a chance that your potential customer is more likely to trust a customer rating rather than a brands claim. According to the Demand Gen’s 2017 B2B Buyer’s Survey – 84% of the buyers said that they look for product details from the existing customers. 57% of them ask for feedback in the first three months of their buying process. This survey also revealed that reviews give out better information on your product as compared to case studies and testimonials. However, reviews validate your claims and take your products to a wider set of audience. Qualify the Leads In a B2C marketing strategy, it’s quite rare that business qualifies the leads. They tend to negate this concept, work on all the leads, and end up with few or no conversions. The best approach is to divide the leads on the basis of their behavior, and then you’ll have an idea who is worth the extended effort. Have a Problem Solving Approach B2C follows this already, but these marketers tend to assume the buying decisions and address the objections to a specified limit. However, a B2B marketer gains proper insights from the problem as they have to go through a long chain before approval. So, with this approach, a B2C marketer can solve all the logical problems until the purchase becomes their next obvious step. Concentrate On Building Relationships Rather Than Just ‘Partnerships’ It comes as no surprise that having partnerships with retailers leads to greater recognition of your products. Not just the recognition, but it also gets you funds that let you increase the value of your brand. But, when you build a relationship (with both brands and customers), your sales go above and beyond the expectations. As you start to deliver a positive experience on a B2B level, they tend to recommend products to their close acquaintances, and more, which is sure to lead an increase in revenue. So, with partnerships, you just get funds, but with the relationship, you get revenues that will help you grow your business. Work With Price Automation According to a Forrester Research, How? The balance lies in the automation of price personalization in the research phase, and then the automatic negotiation of price as the buyer reaches close to purchase. So, if you are a B2C marketer, focus on integrating this practice into your website rather than recreating the marketing wheel. With these B2B strategies for B2C e-commerce, the opportunities are simply enormous. All you need is to take advantage of B2C practices along with the traditional B2B tactics. For example, e.l.f. Cosmetics got a foundation from the B2B strategies ; leveraged supply chain transformation, optimized inventory management process, and spanned both B2C and B2B sales. In just a decade (since its inception), it had its main revenue from B2C sales and B2B sales from Target, Walmart, and other retailers.

Although, there are some ways that can help you achieve this, one of the most important factors is UX or user experience. This is proven through research conducted by eMarketer. Many customers confess that if the user experience is not good they prefer not to make a purchase from an eStore. By now almost every e-store owner knows that user experience or briefly UX can determine the success of an e-store, website or app. It can play a major role in converting prospects into satisfied or returning customers. User experience gets the desired result because with it customers get a much better user experience. With user experience analytics you can gain valuable insight into the attitude and emotions of your customers, toward your e-store. It will help you in adjusting your products or services to fit their needs perfectly. Understanding your customers is the key to building trust between your brand and your customers and this is where UX comes in. Co-creator and the CEO of Moz rightly said that while creating any content, one should be empathetic and try to live the customers’ lives. UX metrics will help you understand your audience better. Learn how to leverage customer data, segmentation, and advanced personalization tools to drive engagement, loyalty, and revenue. Watch our webinar today! User experience analytics for better customer experience But how can UX analytics help you in achieving the desired results? Let’s have a look at the 7 ways UX analytics can help you in evaluating user experience. Drawing insight from average page time and pageviews The Google Analytics Metrics will offer you a good point for entry to start your investigation or research. You will know the reason behind however small or big things happening in your e-store. Average page time With average page time, you will get an estimated duration of your customers’ stay on your page. If you observe a low average page time and a high exit percentage, you can work on finding out the possible reason behind that. The average time on page that your customers are spending will serve as an eye-opener for you. Pageviews With Pageviews, you will know the number of times users visited a site or a section on your eCommerce platform or the entire eStore itself. You can understand if the content of your website is engaging or enticing enough to keep users on the website long enough. In addition to that, with Pageviews, you will also get the number of times the page was reloaded and that will give you an idea of the possible errors on your website. If the users reload the page repeatedly, then there could be some issues with the page. Lowering the bounce rate As you all know, the bounce rate is the percentage of average visits of a page by customers who left without browsing any further. There are pages that are designed for just a single view, like a number or a specific detail page. For such pages, there needs to be metrics to determine if high bounce rates are bad signs. Usually, bounce rates can be a result for many reasons like a complicated signup or form-fill page, bad web design, bad website performance, or poor content. Further, when it’s about an e-store, a high bounce rate can also mean a high cart abandonment rate. Using the System Usability Scale System Usability Scale or briefly SUS is a common tool to measure software usability that is being used since 1986. The System Usability Scale is a 10-question survey, which is cost-effective and used for the assessment of the subject application. You can perform the SUS survey and use a fraction of your customer base to try the questionnaire. Customers will be able to answer the questions with pre-set answer options like, ”strongly agree” or ”strongly disagree.” A System Usability Scale or SUS is an evaluation of your e-store’s overall usability. With the SUS you will identify and gain a good understanding of the areas of improvement. Measuring the UX of your e-commerce with SUPR-Q Jeff Sauro, founding principal, measuring developed the SUPR-Q, the Standard Universal Percentile Rank Questionnaire. It is a method for the evaluation of websites and is based partially on the SUS method. Unlike SUS, the SUPR-Q doesn’t focus on usability only, it also focuses on appearance, loyalty, and trust. It consists of 8 questions and the participants will have to answer using the pre-text options like ”strongly agree” or ”strongly disagree.” Although SUPR-Q is a bit expensive, it can help you in comparing your e-store with the competitors. As mentioned earlier, the SUPR-Q uses the questions to determine, usability, trust, loyalty, and appearance of your website. Serving as an alert for your customer support You can use both SUPR-Q and SUS survey results to measure user experience. At the same time, it is also a useful tool to draw the attention of your customer service or support team on a few specific or recurring concerns. Once you have drawn your customer service team to a concern or issue, they can ask the complainants about their user experience and their feedback. It is an excellent way to identify more areas of improvement while solving customer service or support tickets. Takeaway points Today, the user experience has an important seat at the round table. As we witnessed Amazon, iPhone, and many leading brands realizing and working on good user experience, you should take it seriously too. The above-mentioned functions of UX are too common and there is much more than UX can do and you can do with UX. Knowing your customers is the need of the hour and as you start understanding them, you will be able to sell better too.

      "content": "7 Marketing Mistakes to Avoid for E-commerce Success 7 Marketing Mistakes to Avoid for E-commerce Success Author Category Share A number of things have changed since the greatest dot-com bust in history, Boo.com . Slow dial up connection and lack of e-commerce understanding with consumers are no longer a concern. However, what remains unchanged is the importance of marketing in e-commerce success. According to some reports, in the meeting between investors and the analyst team of Boo.com, the following questions were raised How many visitors are you aiming for? What kind of conversion rate are you aiming for? What’s your marketing expenditure and strategy? What’s your customer acquisition cost? Boo.com team did not have the answer to these questions, which probably led to their failure. While this was years ago, these questions are still valid. To help retailers avoid the similar fate, we have identified the following 7 marketing mistakes that e-commerce businesses must avoid. This is our fifth blog in the “Mistakes to Avoid” series. We encourage you to read those blogs as well. You can find the links at the end of the blog. 1) Not Investing Time to Understand Your Target Audience (think Segmentation) This the most basic mistake that a number of businesses make. I am not saying they operate with the mindset, build the product and customers will come, but a number of businesses fail to go beyond geography, gender, and age. This has implications at so many levels. By not understanding their customers well, businesses invest money in running marketing campaigns and promotions to consumers who will never convert. They offer products to consumers that they will never buy. Bottom line, the customer acquisition cost skyrockets. Moreover, even after spending so much money, businesses rarely know what worked. Because of which they fail to replicate this and miss a number of business opportunities. Hence, it is important that businesses spend time to understand and segment their customers. With segments identified, businesses can run more effective targeted marketing and promotional campaigns. Note – For effective segmentation, businesses will also need access to historical information and data from multiple disconnected systems. Consolidating information from important systems like e-commerce, ERP and CRM is critical. 2) Not Addressing Site SEO Issues Early On Search engines (organic) are the most important source of traffic and revenue for most businesses. This is true for e-commerce as well. Consider these, According to a report from SimilarWeb, In Jan 2016, almost 35% of worldwide e-commerce traffic came from search engines (organic only). According to a Custora report, Free search results represented 23.6% of U.S. e-commerce orders in 2014. According to Marketing Land, 34% of people use search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo to search for products (2015). However, businesses fail to capitalize on this medium to its maximum extent. Reason being, for many long tail keywords related to products, the competition is simply too high and businesses want to rank among top 3 spots overnight. SEO is a long term strategy and businesses have to invest time and energy smartly on a continuous basis. Identify any SEO issues with your landing pages and address them immediately. 3) Investing in Wrong Marketing Channels Do you know how your customers find you? Most businesses don’t and because of which they often fail to utilize their marketing budgets effectively; by investing in channels that do not add to the bottom line. This is where your understanding of your customers also play a big role. Businesses must always begin by identifying how and where customers find them. This would help them pinpoint their sources of revenue generation. They can then invest money in running targeted marketing and promotional campaigns on those channels; trimming down on budgets spent on low performing channels. 4) Treating all Consumers as Same In a time when personalization is scaling to new heights, treating all your consumers as same is a cardinal sin. According to Crazyegg, 74% of users feel frustrated that the content on the website does not appeal to their interest. In addition, according to an Infosys report, 86% of consumers said that personalization has some impact on their purchase decisions. Personalizing your landing pages, product offering (cross-sell, product recommendations, etc.), marketing strategy, promotional offers, email communications, etc. goes a long way in improving conversions and driving customer loyalty . Consider these Leads that are nurtured with targeted content produce a 20% increase in sales opportunities (Demandgen). 84% of marketers believe that personalization positively impacts customer retention and loyalty (Forrester). These are some of the dots that must be connected to achieve the finesse of developing a personalized e-commerce marketing strategy that drives customer satisfaction. 5) Not Having the Right Marketing and Promotions Tools in Place An e-commerce platform might not always be enough to meet all your marketing and promotional requirements. Some businesses adopt an e-commerce platform with limited marketing functionality for budget constraints, while others have greater marketing requirements. In both cases, failing to support your e-commerce platform with the right marketing and promotion tools can be the difference between a successful and a failed business. Marketing and promotion tools today are packed with a lot of advanced functionality that automatically identifies where a customer is in the buying journey and sends targeted messages and promotions. Tools like these can augment your e-commerce store and help you not only attract customers but also convert better. 6) Failing to Retarget Them Consider the following stats, 72% of millennial shoppers are favorable to retargeting (Kissmetrics). Web visitors who are retargeted with display ads are more likely to convert on your website. Retargeting can lead to a 147% higher conversion rate over time in certain industries when used in combination with prospecting, according to CMO. These stats clear show how retargeting, in the world of e-commerce, is one of the most powerful and effective ways to gain new customers or convert old customers again. But according to a study, 46% of online marketers believe that retargeting is grossly underused. Not retargeting your customers, when nearly 72% of online shoppers are likely to abandon their shopping carts prior to making a purchase, is a real bad strategy. Re-engaging consumers, through emails or ads, must be an integral part of an e-commerce strategy . And if it is not part of your strategy, then it is high time you must revisit your e-commerce strategy. Retargeting helps in converting the lost customers by tracking their behavior. The retargeting tools today are so powerful that you can retarget your customers with offers related to specific products they were looking at. In short, retargeting helps you reach the RIGHT PEOPLE at RIGHT PLACES with the RIGHT MESSAGE. 7) Failing to Revisit your Marketing Strategy The marketing strategy cannot remain the same and must be revisited often. The trigger could be a pre-scheduled time, new insights gained or changes in the context you operate. Failing to do that, leads to failed campaigns, ineffective utilization of marketing budgets and more. For example, pop-ups were often used by businesses as an effective strategy to attract visitors attention and drive a certain action. However, Google recently made changes to its algorithm penalizing sites for intrusive pop-ups. For businesses that do not revisit their marketing strategy, this can lead to a drop in search rankings which can further lead to a significant drop in sales.

      "content": "Increase Conversions and Drive Sales with E-commerce Financing - i95Dev Increase Conversions and Drive Sales with eCommerce Financing Author Category Share eCommerce is everywhere. Think for a moment, how many people do you know who have never bought or sold anything online? You will probably be able to count them on fingers. According to a report by Business Insider, the U.S. consumers spent nearly $385 billion online in 2016 and expected to increase to $632 billion by 2020. This, however, will be accompanied by challenges. The competition will rise and attracting new customers will become difficult – a challenge troubling most businesses even today. Businesses will have to find ways to differentiate themselves from competition, attract customers and convert them. One such way would be to offer financing options to customers (a strategy applicable for most businesses but more relevant for high-ticket purchases). Imagine how difficult it would be for customers to let go of that product when they can BUY NOW and PAY LATER – a strategy utilized and perfected by brick-and-mortar retailers. What is e-commerce financing? As discussed above, e-commerce financing refers to the act of giving customers flexible payment options that they can use to buy a product now and pay for it over a period of time (say monthly installments). What are the benefits of e-commerce financing? Some benefits of e-commerce financing include Increases customer engagement, Increases conversion, Increases average order value (AOV), Increases customer loyalty, etc. When is the merchant paid? This depends on the financing solutions company and your agreement with them. But, typically the merchant gets paid upfront in full. Who owns the credit risk? The financing solutions company owns the payment/ credit risk. What is in it for the financer? The financing solutions company charge a small fee for their services. How does it work? Step 1 – The merchant ties up with one of the financing solutions company and integrates (add their code) their payment solution with the e-commerce store. Step 2 – The customers visit the e-commerce store and select the product(s) they wish to purchase. Step 3 – The customers selects the option to buy now and pay later using the call to action button made available through the integration (in step 1). Step 4 – The customer completes the checkout process by sharing some mandatory information. Step 5 – The merchant gets paid depending on the agreement between the merchant and the financing company. The financing company collects the payment from the customer and charges a fee for their services. What options are available out there? There are a number of businesses offering financing solutions like Affirm: Affirm aims to reinvent the financing industry using technology. Their financing solutions are easy to use and flexible. Klarna: Klarna, one of the fastest growing companies in Europe, offers safe and easy-to-use payment solutions to e-commerce stores. Klarna is active in more than 18 markets and works with nearly 65,000 merchants serving 45 million consumers. AfterPay: AfterPay offers swift and manageable financing solutions to merchants across channels – e-commerce, mobile, and in-store. Available only in Australia, AfterPay is used by hundreds of merchants and the list is still growing. Pay4later: Now known as Deko, offers a unique multi-lender platform optimized to maximize sales. Pay4Later offers a great experience in-store, online, on mobile and even over the phone. Pay4later serves more than 1000 online retailers across the UK and is considered one of the safest and fastest e-commerce finance solution in the UK. Zibby: Zibby is a little different from other solutions that targets the non-prime and under-banked customers who intend to buy online. It is a simple financing option that requires less than 30 seconds to integrate with the product and check-out pages. What should I consider when evaluating a financing partner? The top parameters that you must consider while evaluating a partner are: The usability of the service – anything that complicates payment or requires customers to fill in too much information will drive them away. Look for a solution that seamlessly fits into your checkout process. Payment terms and Risk – spend some time to understand when you will get paid, the terms, and how the risk is distributed. The availability of APIs or integration with your e-commerce platform – look for solutions that can easily be integrated with your e-commerce platform. Branding and Customizations – check if the solution can be customized to meet your branding and business (loan terms, loan programs, etc.) requirements. Availability across channels – if you are operating across channels check if the same solution can be leveraged across channels. Managing returns – clarify how things would work in case of returns Payment terms for customers – what would happen if a customer is unable to make a payment? How much will he/she be charged? Work with the financing partner to get the best deal for your customers. Availability of customer service and support – pay extra attention to how the financing company will treat you and your customers. Remember, all positive and negative experiences with the financing company will also be associated with your brand. Remember, the customer experience is the key differentiator and financing companies have done their best to simplify financing as much as possible. Unlike a few years back, when customers were redirected to other websites, made to fill long forms, etc. financing today is available at the click of a button. A number of online merchants have integrated e-commerce financing solutions with their e-commerce store and seen an uplift in their conversion rates, around 25%, and an increase in their average order value, nearly 80%.

All the above factors help in formulating strategies to increase B2B eCommerce sales. Meaning ERP ecommerce integration definitely plays a role in a strategic approach to increase B2B eCommerce sales. Read our new eBook we wrote along with Magento, on key Magento B2B features. Some of the crucial strategies unanimously agreed upon by established B2B eCommerce businesses are. Effective Client support Delays in providing timely customer support chips away your clients, it is imperative. A study by Harvard Business Review states that the average response time for companies is pegged at 42 hours. It is safe to perceive a response time of 42 hours in the age of Amazon as slow. An ERP eCommerce integration can really help you in this aspect. As and when a query related to a change in order or some discrepancy is placed by a customer, a CRM eCommerce integration does the job. The queries are immediately synced back to the CRM against the customer id. This gives your customer representative a real-time view of the customer’s issue. The B2B eCommerce integration even helps the sales representative get an overall view of the client’s previous order history, order status and payments which can help them to establish a pattern to formulate an effective solution to the client’s query. This level of precision from your customer representative team will give your B2B business a loyal customer. A B2B ecommerce integration effectively reduces the time taken by your customer representatives to respond to the client’s queries taking your B2B business a few notches higher. Providing personalized pricing Pricing in B2C environment is easy compared to B2B eCommerce given the complexity of their pricing function. The reason for this complexity is the way orders are placed on a regular basis for large quantities by the customers, discounts and varied prices for different types of customers is what makes pricing in B2B complex. A B2B eCommerce integration eases the scope of dynamic pricing system, which is how a B2B eCommerce business functions. Some of the typical B2B eCommerce scenario functions are Creating multiple pricing lists for volumes, fixed pricing, and discounted products Applying these lists to prospect and existing clients and customer groups Applying minimum and maximum limits for the number of products ordered Checking the invoices of the deals before approving Providing further loyalty and reward points to customers if applicable Effective omnichannel management What is a typical B2C scenario? A shopper does his research from her mobile, web rooming on a physical store to compare prices, checks it again on her way during the commute and finally places an order from her laptop. This same procedure is even applied to B2B e-commerce, customers bounce from device to device for research, consideration and finally order placement. A B2B e-commerce integration helps in this aspect greatly and presents a perfect omnichannel strategy in place for you. The inventory levels, product details, prices and various other critical factors required to make a decision are populated from the ERP and PIM system and projected onto the eCommerce platform. A B2B eCommerce integration allows your eCommerce platform to act a single point hub for managing inventory, product and sales from a single point irrespective of the channel. Increased scope of self-service Another main reason for the 96% of B2B businesses to vouch for B2B eCommerce integration is the ability to provide self-service. The ease with which the customer can track, modify their orders and payments is what made B2C stand out from B2B. But with the B2C features being replicated here customers expect the same even in a B2B scenario. With a B2B e-commerce integration, the prospect of your customers tracking their orders, modifying the quantity of inventory placed and even method of payments dynamically becomes easy. This drastically reduces the burden on your resources who would not have to update each and every modification and in turn, even reduces the scope for errors. We see a real positive Domino effect due to the B2B eCommerce integration in place.

Author Category Share In today’s competitive markets, you are bound to face stiff competition and B2B markets are no different. Managing a B2B eCommerce pricing strategy is one of the major problems faced by many key players in the market. The pricing strategy can differ based on customers, type and value of the purchase and so on. The key role in such cases is played by the eCommerce platforms, as these platforms must be capable of handling such complex pricing use cases. Here are a few such strategies that most B2B players intend to use online. Limited Period Pricing- B2B eCommerce business has several types of customers and you need to offer different prices to different types of customers. It is quite possible that you do not want to offer all types of discounts for all types of customers. This becomes a huge problem if the eCommerce platform you use cannot automate the pricing based on time or date for you. Promotional Strategies- Every B2B has strong promotional strategies planned but when it comes to eCommerce they should also be easy for you to it set on your eCommerce platform and also easy for customers to view. Value-based pricing- For B2B business, ‘value’ is a very big word as it varies from customer to customer. Pricing needs to be different for different customer basis the value of the purchase. There are times when you even want to offer a value-off on a certain amount of purchase and that has proven to be a mess when managing at a B2B level business where you have several customers and offerings. Therefore, to overcome all the above problems we will help you in making your jobs much easier by using Microsoft Dynamics GP Extended Pricing Integration on Magento our eCommerce platform. Microsoft Dynamics GP offers two different pricing options namely Standard Pricing and Extended Pricing. Depending upon your business requirements you can choose the pricing option you need as both the types are beneficial if chosen and used wisely. Extended Pricing helps you achieve the following: Date-specific pricing – This feature enables you to set pricing for a selected period or the pricing you want to be populated on a particular date only. So if you wish to sell a range of products at a discounted price only for a week, you can always select from and to Date. Post the period selected, the products will automatically display in their base price or you can again enter some other price. Promotional pricing – Extended pricing integration can be used at its best for promotions of items. Promotional pricing is the most powerful sales promotion strategy in which prices of the items to be promoted are reduced drastically for a short duration. This helps retailers and manufacturers to attract customers and spread awareness about the product. Value-off pricing – In cases where items are purchased in bulk quantity form manufactures they usually offer some new items free. This often has been proved one of the best sales tactics used by many retailers, manufacturers and distributors. Value-based pricing – This feature helps you to set the pricing of the basis of the products their current value in the market. For example, the sale of cold drinks reaches their peak in the summer season, and you usually find maximum discounts during these months as compared to the rest of the time. As the value of the product becomes high, that is the time you can make more profit. Therefore, the extended pricing integration will make your work easier to set pricing for the items for a specific season. We at i95Dev have successfully accomplished Microsoft Dynamics GP Extended Pricing Integration for one of the world’s leading B2B companies, based in Canada that deals in the traffic safety industry. The company offers a wide range of traffic safety products and services and had a complex pricing structure. The company faced several issues in allowing the customers to know about their offers and discounts. Customers used to call the customer relationship team every time they wanted to make a purchase just to know about any discounts. This way many potential customers never called and remained clueless about their offerings. This was a big problem for their customer relationship team and a huge inconvenience for customers. Therefore, our Integration experts at i95dev enabled the company to go for Microsoft Dynamics GP Extended Pricing Integration on Magento as that eased out their work on setting variant pricing for different customers, different times and different packages of services and products. Our Unique Method of Integration: We have efficiently created an Extended Pricing Integration module for Magento and Dynamics GP that integrated all the extended pricing information from Microsoft Dynamics GP to Magento. Therefore, if the customer updates prices on Microsoft Dynamics GP, our i95dev Connector will automatically update those prices on Magento. Benefits of Extended Pricing Integration Extended Pricing Integration enables you to draw more traffic to your website during a specific season. By offering various attractive discounts, you can increase the number of customers or for those matters even visitors that may even end up making a purchase on your website. By setting multiple pricing brackets for your loyal customers, you can offer them beneficial discounts in order to increase the lifetime value of a customer. The customer feels valued when you give some additional offerings as compared to others and thus increases his purchases with you as he gets the best customer experience with you. You can achieve this by setting Extended Pricing- customer-specific pricing. A customer who benefits from repeated offers and promotional discounts is most likely to come back to your website every time he wants to make a purchase and increase his average order value. The extended pricing makes it so easy for you to nudge a customer to buy a higher quantity of products when you want him to buy. It is most likely that a buyer is planning to purchase a certain amount of products but just when he looks at your multiple pricing offerings he ends up purchasing and paying more to you. It is human nature to compare with others, and astute negotiators always compare prices with their competitors. With the help of extended pricing, you can set different prices and benefits to different customers where they feel to be treated especially from others hence giving a better customer experience. I am sure that your marketing team is working hard in practicing various marketing and promotional strategies to make you profit, so why not give their efforts a boost and make their work easier by choosing Microsoft Dynamics GP Extended Pricing Integration. We at i95Dev have a successful history of doing so, for various leading companies in today’s market with our Microsoft Dynamics GP integrations.

Built on a commitment to quality and affordability, the company serves both B2B and B2C customers across the United States. Industry Automotive Aftermarket Headquarters Placentia,California, US Products used Adobe Commerce (Magento), PIM How We Made It Happen About the Company A leading automotive aftermarket manufacturer specializing in high-quality steering, brake, and suspension components. The company delivers reliable, performance-driven solutions for classic cars and trucks. Goals & Challenges The company wanted to strengthen its digital presence with an eCommerce platform capable of delivering a seamless and flexible buying experience. Their catalog included not only standalone parts but also bundled kits: Fixed Kits – predefined bundles with fixed subparts. Breakout Kits – configurable bundles where customers could replace subparts with alternatives. Managing these recursive BOM (part-within-a-part) structures was a major challenge because most eCommerce, PIM, and ERP platforms did not support them. Manual processes for pricing, order management, and inventory tracking slowed down operations and increased the risk of errors. The lack of integration between their eCommerce store and backend MOM system limited visibility, reduced operational efficiency, and negatively impacted customer experience. i95Dev partnered with the manufacturer to deliver a comprehensive Adobe Commerce (Magento) solution integrated with their MOM system, addressing complex product structures and operational bottlenecks. Key features & customizations Recursive BOM (Part-within-a-Part) Support Enabled Adobe Commerce to manage both Fixed Kits and Breakout Kits and allowed customers to configure Breakout Kits by swapping subparts. Dynamic Pricing Engine Implemented custom pricing logic that honors distinct rules for Fixed Kits and Breakout Kits. Pricing rules from MOM are synced and final prices are calculated and displayed in real time. MOM System Integration Automated synchronization of products, kits, pricing, and inventory between Adobe Commerce and MOM, enabling accurate product data and streamlined order flows into the backend system. Catalog & Product Management Enhancements: Optimized Adobe Commerce to efficiently manage CPP’s 80,000+ product catalog . Improved categorization and search functionality for easier navigation. Enhanced product detail pages to clearly display kit components and options. Customer Experience Improvements Introduced a dynamic kit configurator for Breakout Kits, modernized the storefront UI/UX, and simplified navigation so customers can find and personalize parts more easily.

      "content": "Trimax Success Story | Adobe Commerce & Dynamics 365 F&O B2B Success Story # How Trimax Reimagined B2B Commerce for Manufacturers with i95Dev Founded over 40 years ago in New Zealand, Trimax Mowing Systems has grown into a globally respected manufacturer of commercial mowing equipment. Known for engineering precision, reliability, and low-maintenance design, Trimax serves customers across the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia—supporting industries such as sports turf management, public works, airports, and large-scale landscaping. As Trimax expanded globally, customer expectations evolved. Dealers and business buyers began demanding faster onboarding, accurate pricing, seamless ordering, and self-service access—without compromising the complexity and controls required in manufacturing-led B2B commerce. To sustain growth and deliver a modern buying experience, Trimax needed a connected commerce ecosystem that unified complex products, ERP-driven operations, and dealer workflows into a single, scalable digital platform. Industry Commercial Manufacturing and Agricultural Equipment Headquarters Tauranga, New Zealand Products used Adobe Commerce, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operation How We Made It Happen About the Company Trimax Mowing Systems is a global manufacturer and innovator in commercial mowing equipment, recognized for building smarter machines that deliver better outcomes for customers. With a strong international dealer and distributor network, Trimax continues to expand its footprint across markets while maintaining a reputation for engineering excellence. Goals & Challenges Trimax’s digital transformation focused on modernizing B2B commerce while preserving manufacturing accuracy and operational control. Managing Complex Product Assemblies: Trimax products are built from multiple interconnected assemblies and sub-parts—each with specific compatibility rules and lifecycles. Their existing digital setup lacked the structure needed to sell complete assemblies and replacement parts confidently online. Handling High-Value & Mixed Transactions: While smaller parts could be purchased instantly, large mower assemblies required custom freight handling, quote-based pricing, and approvals. The absence of flexible transaction logic disrupted buying journeys and increased friction for high-ticket purchases. ERP Integration & Data Consistency: Although Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations served as the ERP backbone, limited integration with eCommerce resulted in inconsistencies across pricing, tax handling, customer accounts, and order processing—leading to manual work and operational inefficiencies. Serving Dealers and End Customers Together: Trimax supports both dealers and direct customers—each with different pricing models, payment terms, approvals, and tax requirements. The existing system lacked the sophistication to manage onboarding, verification, and ERP synchronization efficiently. Despite these challenges, Trimax’s vision was clear: simplify complexity, strengthen dealer relationships, and build a scalable digital foundation for global growth. i95Dev partnered with Trimax to design and implement a B2B commerce ecosystem that mirrors how the business actually operates. 1.

With deep expertise in regulatory frameworks, continuing education requirements, and compliance-driven training, HCPro delivers masterclasses, certifications, virtual programs, CE courses, publications, and hybrid learning experiences. As HCPro’s catalog and customer base expanded, so did the complexity of its digital operations. Managing regulated learning programs, institutional purchasing, multi-attendee registrations, and compliance workflows demanded more than a traditional eCommerce platform. HCPro recognized the need for a modern, learning-aware commerce ecosystem—one that could unify systems, reduce operational risk, and deliver a seamless experience for institutions, learners, and internal teams alike. Industry Healthcare Training & Compliance Education Headquarters Chicago, Illinois, United States Products used Adobe Commerce How We Made It Happen About the Company HCPro is a leading provider of healthcare compliance and professional education. More than a content publisher or event organizer, HCPro acts as a learning partner for thousands of healthcare organizations navigating complex regulatory and accreditation requirements. Goals & Challenges HCPro’s digital transformation focused on modernizing learning commerce while preserving compliance accuracy and operational control. Key Challenges Representing Regulated Learning as Digital Products Each training program required rich, structured metadata—dates, locations, CE credits, instructors, compliance disclaimers, and SKU-specific rules. HCPro’s legacy platform could list programs but could not represent the true structure of regulated learning. Multi-Attendee, Compliance-Heavy Transactions Institutional purchases often included multiple attendees, each with unique credentials, licenses, and compliance requirements. Without guided workflows, HCPro’s teams spent significant time chasing incomplete information. Serving Institutions and Individual Learners Hospitals and healthcare systems needed bulk registration, invoicing, and compliance data capture, while individual learners expected simplicity. The existing digital flow struggled to serve both audiences efficiently. Fragmented Systems & Content Silos Critical data was spread across Magento, Drupal, and .NET systems. Manual duplication of event details and content updates increased the risk of inconsistencies and compliance gaps. Despite these challenges, HCPro’s vision was clear: build a learning-commerce platform designed for regulated education—not just transactions. i95Dev partnered with HCPro to reshape Adobe Commerce into a learning-aware digital ecosystem, tailored to regulated training providers. 1. Learning-Aware Product Architecture Rebuilt training programs as structured digital products Captured event schedules, CE credits, instructors, locations, and compliance notes Enabled buyers to clearly understand program requirements before purchase 2. Multi-Attendee Registration Engine Designed workflows for institutions registering multiple learners Guided attendee data capture with role, license, credentials, and department Prevented incomplete submissions through validation at checkout 3. Admin & Operational Enablement Enabled post-purchase attendee edits and roster management Allowed clean manual registrations and program updates Delivered visibility into order sources and institutional activity 4. Unified Content & Commerce Ecosystem Integrated Adobe Commerce with Drupal and .NET Synchronized event data, categories, and content automatically Eliminated duplication and ensured consistent information across channels 1200+ Projects Completed 450+ Customers across 15+ Countries 25+ Industries served 150+ eCommerce Enthusiasts Let’s Connect Real Impact.

      "content": "How We Made It Happen About the Company HCPro is a leading provider of healthcare compliance and professional education. More than a content publisher or event organizer, HCPro acts as a learning partner for thousands of healthcare organizations navigating complex regulatory and accreditation requirements. Goals & Challenges HCPro’s digital transformation focused on modernizing learning commerce while preserving compliance accuracy and operational control. Key Challenges Representing Regulated Learning as Digital Products Each training program required rich, structured metadata—dates, locations, CE credits, instructors, compliance disclaimers, and SKU-specific rules. HCPro’s legacy platform could list programs but could not represent the true structure of regulated learning. Multi-Attendee, Compliance-Heavy Transactions Institutional purchases often included multiple attendees, each with unique credentials, licenses, and compliance requirements. Without guided workflows, HCPro’s teams spent significant time chasing incomplete information. Serving Institutions and Individual Learners Hospitals and healthcare systems needed bulk registration, invoicing, and compliance data capture, while individual learners expected simplicity. The existing digital flow struggled to serve both audiences efficiently. Fragmented Systems & Content Silos Critical data was spread across Magento, Drupal, and .NET systems. Manual duplication of event details and content updates increased the risk of inconsistencies and compliance gaps. Despite these challenges, HCPro’s vision was clear: build a learning-commerce platform designed for regulated education—not just transactions. i95Dev partnered with HCPro to reshape Adobe Commerce into a learning-aware digital ecosystem, tailored to regulated training providers. 1. Learning-Aware Product Architecture Rebuilt training programs as structured digital products Captured event schedules, CE credits, instructors, locations, and compliance notes Enabled buyers to clearly understand program requirements before purchase 2. Multi-Attendee Registration Engine Designed workflows for institutions registering multiple learners Guided attendee data capture with role, license, credentials, and department Prevented incomplete submissions through validation at checkout 3. Admin & Operational Enablement Enabled post-purchase attendee edits and roster management Allowed clean manual registrations and program updates Delivered visibility into order sources and institutional activity 4. Unified Content & Commerce Ecosystem Integrated Adobe Commerce with Drupal and .NET Synchronized event data, categories, and content automatically Eliminated duplication and ensured consistent information across channels 1200+ Projects Completed 450+ Customers across 15+ Countries 25+ Industries served 150+ eCommerce Enthusiasts Let’s Connect",

      "content": "ChatGPT Ads for eCommerce: Opportunity or Costly Distraction? OpenAI’s ChatGPT Ads: A New Frontier for eCommerce Discovery or a Costly Distraction? On January 16, 2026, OpenAI announced ads in ChatGPT, signaling how AI platforms will monetize while broadening user access. Testing starts soon for logged-in U.S. adults using the free and ChatGPT Go ($8/month) plans. Ads won’t appear for Plus, Pro, Business, or Enterprise users. These ads appear at the bottom of responses, clearly labeled and visually separated from organic answers. They are triggered by relevance to the current conversation; think sponsored hot sauce recommendations during a recipe query or cozy cabin options in travel planning. OpenAI stresses user controls: ads are optional for personalization, data is never sold to advertisers, and feedback tools allow users to dismiss or refine them. Sensitive topics (health, politics, etc.) are excluded. The objective is clear: fund broader access to AI, reduce usage caps for free users, and align with OpenAI’s mission to benefit humanity through AGI. Early indicators suggest a focus on useful, entertaining, discovery-oriented ads that fit naturally into conversational flows. Opportunities for eCommerce Brands in an Intent-Rich Channel Conversational AI like ChatGPT often captures users at high-intent moments, such as “best running shoes for beginners,” “budget-friendly weeknight meals,” or “unique gifts for coworkers.” These queries signal active shopping consideration, far more qualified than passive social scrolling or broad search terms. For eCommerce businesses, this creates several strategic advantages: Contextual, intent-based ads reach users with a need. This can drive better click-through and conversions than traditional campaigns. Level playing field for emerging brands : OpenAI highlights access. Smaller or niche eCommerce stores can gain visibility alongside major players through relevant, AI-optimized listings, without the need for massive creative budgets. Pathway to conversational commerce : Future updates may enable interactive follow-ups (e.g., “Tell me more about this product,” leading to purchase flows), aligning with agentic commerce trends where AI assists with comparison, recommendations, and buying. Early-journey capture : Many product searches now start with AI tools rather than traditional search engines. Brands that appear here can build awareness and drive traffic at the top of the funnel. Categories like lifestyle, food & beverage, home goods, travel, and fashion stand to benefit most from this high-intent discovery layer. Challenges and Risks to Monitor Closely Despite the promise, several factors warrant caution: Potential premium pricing : Industry reports suggest entry costs could be higher than those of established platforms like Meta or Google, making it a higher-stakes test for budget-conscious brands. User perception and trust : Introducing ads into a “helpful” AI experience can make it feel intrusive, even with clear labeling. If users sense commercialization, they may opt for ad-free paid tiers or switch to another platform. Limited initial scale : U.S.-only testing, logged-in adults, free/Go tiers only. No ads for premium users (often higher spenders) or on sensitive topics. Broad rollout will take time. Competitive intensity : Deep-pocketed brands may dominate early auctions. Smaller eCommerce players will need optimized, AI-friendly product data to compete effectively. New channels often launch at a premium and exclusive offerings before performance data enables wider accessibility. Early adopters may capture outsized gains. Strategic Takeaway for eCommerce Leaders ChatGPT ads represent one of the most intent-focused advertising opportunities to emerge in recent years. This channel could redefine product discovery, especially for brands ready to adapt to listings for AI visibility (with clear descriptions, high-quality images, and accurate pricing). At i95Dev, we view this as an additional layer in the evolving eCommerce ecosystem, not a replacement for proven channels, but a powerful complement for brands prioritizing relevance and user experience. Our main recommendation: closely track U.S. test results, begin preparing AI-optimized content now, and initiate limited trials as access widens. Brands that act thoughtfully and early will be ready to lead in AI-powered commerce as this channel develops. Stay updated with i95dev for more eCommerce insights and strategies.",

If you’re a retailer, marketer, or simply a savvy shopper, understanding Google’s UCP could be key to staying ahead in the digital marketplace. Let’s dive into what this innovative protocol means for the future of eCommerce. What is Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol? Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol, or UCP, is an open-source standard designed to create a unified language for AI agents, retailers, and payment systems. Developed in collaboration with industry giants like Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, Walmart, Adyen, American Express, Best Buy, Flipkart, Macy’s, Mastercard, Stripe, The Home Depot, and Visa , UCP simplifies the fragmented landscape of eCommerce APIs into a single, secure layer. At its core, UCP enables “agentic commerce,” where AI agents handle everything from browsing and inventory checks to payments and order management. It’s compatible with existing protocols like Agent2Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and Model Context Protocol (MCP), making it vendor-agnostic and easy for businesses of all sizes to adopt. Launched with a focus on U.S. retailers, UCP is set for global expansion, empowering direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands to compete on a level playing field. Key Features of Google UCP Google’s UCP isn’t just hype, it’s packed with features that integrate AI deeply into eCommerce: Business Agent : This is a branded AI chatbot that appears in Google Search results, acting as a virtual sales assistant. It answers customer queries in your brand’s unique voice, drawing from product data, customer insights, and even special offers. Early adopters include Lowe’s, Michaels Stores, Poshmark, and Reebok , with customization available through Google’s Merchant Center. Direct Offers : A pilot program for AI-powered ads that deliver exclusive discounts right in the user’s search experience. For instance, if someone searches for a “high-traffic dining room rug,” Google’s AI might highlight a 20% off deal from participating retailers like Petco, e.l.f. Cosmetics, Samsonite, or Rugs USA. It starts with discounts but will expand to bundles and free shipping. New Data Attributes in Merchant Center : Retailers can now add conversational details like FAQs, compatible accessories, product comparisons, and alternatives. These attributes fuel AI platforms like Gemini and AI Mode, enhancing product visibility and personalization. AI-Powered Checkout : Shoppers can complete purchases directly in Google Search or the Gemini app using saved info from Google Wallet, PayPal, or Google Pay, eliminating the need to jump between apps. These features make UCP a powerhouse for conversational commerce, turning everyday searches into intuitive shopping experiences. Benefits for Businesses, Marketers, and Shoppers The advantages of Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol extend across the eCommerce ecosystem: For Businesses : Say goodbye to costly custom integrations. With UCP, a single setup lets you connect AI agents to your inventory and payments seamlessly. You remain the merchant of record, owning customer data and relationships. Small and mid-sized businesses can innovate like enterprises, capturing sales at peak intent and reducing cart abandonment. Plus, tools like Business Agent provide valuable insights into customer interactions. For Marketers : UCP shifts focus from traditional keywords to intent-based optimization. Features like Direct Offers allow for targeted promotions, while enhanced attribution tracks ROI across AI touchpoints. Adobe’s data shows a 693% surge in generative AI traffic during holidays; UCP amplifies this by ensuring clean product feeds and real-time inventory for better visibility. For Shoppers : Imagine asking Gemini for outfit ideas and getting recommendations, comparisons, and a one-click purchase; all in one conversation. UCP makes shopping frictionless, secure, and personalized, with no app-hopping required. Overall, UCP levels the playing field, boosts efficiency, and fosters innovation in AI e-commerce. How Google’s UCP Works in Action UCP acts as the “plumbing” for agentic commerce, standardizing interactions so AI agents can operate autonomously. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Product Discovery : Users interact conversationally with AI (e.g., via Google Search or Gemini). The agent pulls from Merchant Center data to suggest products, answer questions, and highlight deals. Negotiation and Offers : Through Direct Offers, AI presents contextual discounts based on search intent, like a bundle deal for related items. Checkout and Fulfillment : Secure payments happen in-app using protocols like AP2, with the retailer handling order management. Post-Purchase Support : Business Agents provide ongoing assistance, from tracking to returns. For example, a user searching for home decor might chat with a retailer’s AI agent, compare options, apply a discount, and buy them all without leaving Google. This seamless flow reduces drop-offs and enhances user satisfaction. Future Implications of UCP in eCommerce As AI in eCommerce grows, UCP could redefine the industry. Expect expanded features like loyalty rewards integration, custom shopping experiences, and deeper customer insights. However, challenges loom: websites might see less traffic as AI handles more interactions, and data quality becomes critical (garbage in, garbage out). Businesses should prepare by optimizing Merchant Center feeds, testing Business Agents, and exploring Direct Offers. With Google’s dominance in search and AI, early adoption could give brands a competitive edge in conversational commerce. In summary, Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol isn’t just a tool; it’s a blueprint for the future of online shopping. By bridging AI, retailers, and payments, UCP promises a more intuitive, efficient eCommerce world. Stay tuned as this protocol rolls out globally and transforms how we buy and sell.",

      "content": "Shopify’s Agentic Commerce & UCP: The Future of Ecommerce Shopify’s Agentic Commerce Revolution: The Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) and Its Game-Changing Potential for eCommerce The ecommerce landscape just took a major leap forward. On January 11, 2026, Shopify unveiled its agentic commerce platform , a powerful new system built on the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) , an open standard co-developed with Google and endorsed by more than 20 retailers and platforms. This isn’t just another AI feature. It’s a deliberate strategy to make commerce native across major AI channels, turning conversational interfaces like Google AI Mode in Search, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and more into seamless shopping destinations. For merchants, developers, and brands, the implications are profound. What Is Agentic Commerce and UCP? Agentic commerce allows AI agents to discover products, handle personalized recommendations, manage complex checkout flows, and complete transactions on behalf of customers, all within natural conversations. At the core is UCP , an open-source protocol that acts as a “universal language” between merchants and AI agents. It supports critical commerce elements that traditional AI integrations often struggle with: Discounts, loyalty programs, and subscription billing Delivery preferences and custom terms (e.g., “ship on Friday, not Thursday”) Bundling, pre-orders, and final-sale conditions Compatibility with any payment processor, including Shopify Payments Flexible transaction types: conversational, embedded checkouts, or web-based flows UCP ensures merchants remain in control as the Merchant of Record , preserving business rules while enabling AI agents to deliver accurate, context-driven experiences. Shopify is also rolling out the Agentic plan , allowing non-Shopify brands to upload their catalogs and sell directly through AI channels without migrating to the platform. Meanwhile, Agentic Storefronts give merchants centralized management in Shopify Admin, and integrations are already live or coming soon with Google (AI Mode & Gemini), Microsoft Copilot (embedded checkout), and ChatGPT. The Upside: A New Era of Frictionless, Personalized Shopping For ecommerce businesses, the advantages are compelling: Reach customers where intent peaks — AI agents surface products in real-time conversations, delivering deals and recommendations exactly when shoppers are asking questions. Merit-based discovery — Products appear based on relevance and context rather than ad spend or SEO gaming, potentially leveling the playing field for niche and emerging brands. Reduced friction and higher conversion — Complex flows like subscriptions, bundling, and personalized delivery become effortless in chat, building customer habits and loyalty. Broader distribution without heavy lifting — Brands like Monos, Gymshark, Everlane, Keen, and Pura Vida are already participating in early integrations, reaching millions through AI surfaces. This could accelerate online shopping in the same way mobile and COVID-era shifts did, only faster and more personalized. The Potential Downsides: Adaptation, Adoption, and Disruption No platform shift is without challenges: Gradual rollout — Most experts expect agentic commerce to start as an occasional channel before becoming dominant. Early experiences may not be flawless, and widespread adoption will take time. SEO and paid search disruption — If AI agents deliver unbiased, context-driven results, traditional search engine visibility and ad-driven discovery could lose relevance, forcing marketers to rethink strategies. New operational demands — Merchants will need clean, structured catalogs and ongoing merchandising efforts to stay competitive in AI feeds. Smaller teams may face a learning curve. Dependency on ecosystem buy-in — For agentic commerce to reach its full potential, a wide range of brands must participate. If adoption lags, selection could remain limited. The Bottom Line for eCommerce Businesses Shopify’s agentic commerce platform and UCP represent a foundational move toward a future where commerce flows naturally through every conversational interface, search, assistants, productivity tools, and beyond. For forward-thinking brands, this is an opportunity to gain first-mover advantage, reach shoppers in high-intent moments, and build loyalty through delightful, frictionless experiences. For others, it’s a signal to prepare catalogs, monitor integrations, and adapt strategies as AI becomes a primary channel for discovery and purchase. The race to agentic commerce has begun. Early participants will help define the rules, and the winners will be the brands that master this new shared language of commerce. At i95Dev, we’re closely tracking this shift and helping clients position their catalogs and strategies for the agentic era. The future of ecommerce is conversational, open, and incredibly promising.

      "content": "How Shopify Dynamics NAV Integration Benefits You - i95Dev How Shopify Dynamics NAV Integration Benefits You Author Category Share After your Shopify store starts receiving orders frequently, it becomes necessary to implement ERP integration to keep up with the increasing complexities. Dynamics NAV is a forerunner with its comprehensive features, technical superiority, and support availability among all offerings available in the market. It can provide your Shopify store with numerous operational and tactical advantages to help improve your ROI, business agility , and capabilities at large. (Image Credits) The eCommerce market is forecasted to touch $6.388 Billion by 2024. Today, we will have a look at various factors that can work to your benefit after the Shopify-Dynamics NAV Integration implementation. This article is curated to be in line with the evolving situations due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Let’s see how you can grow your Shopify store using Microsoft Dynamics NAV: Which Problems Can Be Solved By Shopify-Dynamics NAV Integration One of the most common problems any growing eCommerce store faces is getting overwhelmed by the operational processes. Upto a few orders on a daily basis, you can use Shopify’s built-in manual processing features. But, after exceeding a certain threshold, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage operations. Verifying inventory availability, shipping charges on a carrier-wise basis, payment authentication, returns processing, order tracking, and product bundling are among the major problems faced. All of these activities need to be well-coordinated and properly documented for accounting and auditing purposes. You might have to manually input and maintain multiple databases across departments which ends up with complications due to overlapping data and work duplication. In simple words, each aspect of operations becomes increasingly challenging. Reduce Buffer Stock And Optimize Inventory Lead Time With a better estimate of your product consumption rates and sales forecasting features, you can reduce the buffer stock strategically. Dynamics NAV also helps you optimize your lead time calculations and aids in vendor profiling. This will lower your inventory carrying costs and free up your warehouse space of the extra inventory. In the absence of a fully managed, integrated solution, you will either overstock certain items or constantly face shortages despite good demand. You may also find that old inventory will be piled up at your storage facility, and your staff might be shipping only new stock. You will also be able to use sales data for demand forecasting and estimating EOQs (economic order quantity) for your online business. It also prompts you the list of items that need to be discarded for making space for more profitable items and provides bundling suggestions as well. Automate Order Processing Microsoft Dynamics NAV will help automate order processing-related activities. This includes displaying available item quantity, shipping charges, estimated delivery time, payment confirmation, and invoicing on a real-time basis. Shopify-ERP integration can help prevent problems caused due to skyrocketing increase in online sales. You can see the sharp changes that occurred during and after 2020 in the below infographic: (Image Credits) (Image Credits) Automation is the only way to cope up with such a radical increase in demand since online selling involves numerous peripheral activities with each transaction. On the other hand, it gives you the ability to upscale and downscale your operations with virtually zero cost. Real-Time Bi-directional Data Synchronisation All activities are recorded in a centralized database through automation and manual entries whenever needed. This eliminates the need for multiple data entries, and it acts as the single source of truth. All human errors are minimized, and your organization’s various departments can work in harmony with each other. The bi-directional synchronization also supports gated access to information for maintaining data fidelity. This is a great benefit since each process of your eCommerce store is expedited without compromising operational accuracy. The resultant system will provide you with a compounded enhancement of all business processes. Thus, we can consider the benefits availed from the integration to be design-based. Enhanced Customer Satisfaction You can expect a decent increase in customer retention and CX as they are able to benefit from your improvised infrastructure. For instance, your Shopify store’s customers can get the most affordable shipping option thanks to real-time sync. In addition, you can provide them with exciting marketing offers, bundled deals, discount grids, and personalized discounts. Microsoft Dynamics NAV also provides you with features to automate replacements and refunds as a part of automated service request processing. Thus, you can unlock a lot of client-oriented functionalities using Shopify-Dynamics integration. Also, the pandemic has augmented customer behavior heavily, and this will make improvised client servicing capabilities a necessity in the days to come.
